# Decisions

Why this codebase is the way it is, component by component, so a settled argument is not had twice. Every
entry here is local: it explains one control, one abstract's internals, the shape of the repo or the
Playground, and would not survive a move to another project.

**The rules that would survive such a move are in `conventions.md`**, which is the file to read first and
the only one worth carrying anywhere else. The two cross-reference each other by heading name.

Open problems are in `backlog.md`; nothing here is a task. `backlog.md`'s numbered items point at the
headings below for the reasoning behind what exists.

## Repo

### The three trees

`@thewaver/ss-components` is a SolidJS component library plus a Playground app documenting it.
Vanilla-extract for styles, Vite for both builds. It shares this repo with `@thewaver/ss-utils`; see
_"One repo, three packages"_ for why and for what that changes.

- **`utils/src`** — `@thewaver/ss-utils`, published separately and depended on by the other two. Its
  own conventions travel with it, including the documented exports; see _"`ss-utils` is the opposite"_
  in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **`components/src`** — the published library, and the only tree with a support contract (see
  _"Compatibility arguments"_).
- **`playground/src`** — the demo app. Every consumer-side painter lives in `App/StyledComponents`,
  named `<LibComponent>Content` after the shell whose slot it fills, with the playground-wide `Page`
  prefix: `PageButtonContent`, `PageCheckboxContent`, `PageTooltipContent`. `App/PageComponents`
  holds the playground's own furniture: `PageVariants`, `PageExamples`, `PageCodeBox`.

**The line between the two folders is the library, not the shape of the thing.** Anything that
dresses a library component belongs in `StyledComponents`, even when it is not a `renderContent`
painter and even when it composes several controls — `Field`, `ColorChannels`, `CalendarCaption`
and `LabelCaption` sat in `PageComponents` until on the grounds that they were
compositions rather than paint, which was the wrong test. `PageComponents` is what the Playground
would still need if the library did not exist. The `<LibComponent>Content` naming is for slot
painters only; these keep the name of the thing they are.

- **`e2e/`** — Playwright interaction suite. Imports from neither tree; drives the built Playground in
  a real browser. See _"Verifying interaction"_ in `conventions.md`.

### One repo, three packages

`ss-utils` used to be a separate clone next door, and the cost of that was not theoretical: a fix that
belonged in the parser had to be parked here commented out, a utility that qualified for the move was left
behind because the other repo was not on the machine, and `EasingUtils` was written to this repo's rules
while waiting to be copied across by hand. The user's call to merge them, and `ss-utils` came across with
its history rather than as a copy, so `git blame` on a `utils/` file still reaches its original commits —
under its old path, since the files moved.

**Both packages stay separately publishable.** `utils` and `components` each own a `package.json` with its
own version, `files: ["dist"]` and export map, and each is published on its own with `npm publish -w`. The
root `package.json` is `private` and exists only to hold the workspace list, the shared tooling and the
scripts. `playground` is a third workspace, also private, so that its dependencies are declared rather than
borrowed from whatever the library happened to install.

**Npm workspaces and nothing else.** No pnpm, no Lerna, no Nx, no Turborepo: npm links each package into
the root `node_modules` by itself, and the build order is one `&&` in one script. A task runner earns its
place when the graph is too big to write down, and three packages in a line is not that.

**The Playground imports the library the way a consumer does**, through `@thewaver/ss-components`, rather
than by reaching into `components/src` along a relative path as it did when both were one tree. The point
is that the export list is now load-bearing: a component missing from `index.ts` breaks the Playground
instead of going unnoticed. The user's call, taken with the cost below on the table.

**There is no alias into `components/src` any more.** `@components/…` existed for one reason: twenty
`CellAnimationWeights` samples and one `CellAnimationZones` const reached `CellAnimationUtils` as a leaf module
rather than through `index.ts`, because their unit tests run in plain Node and loading the whole library there
calls Solid's `delegateEvents` at module scope and dies without a `window`. Moving the samples into
`components/src` made that an ordinary relative import inside one package, so the alias, its three definition
sites and the DOM-test-environment question all went away together. See _"Samples live in the library"_.

**Everything except the publish build resolves `ss-utils` from source.** The Vite dev server, the Vite
Playground build, both Vitest configs and both `tsconfig.json` path maps point `@thewaver/ss-utils` at
`utils/src`, so editing a helper shows up in the Playground on save with nothing rebuilt. The library's own
Vite build is the exception and deliberately so: `ss-utils` is listed in `EXTERNAL_PACKAGES` there, is never
bundled into `components/dist`, and the emitted `.d.ts` still imports from the package by name. `tsup`'s
declaration pass does read `utils/dist`, which is why `npm run build` builds `utils` first.

**Aligning `utils` with `verbatimModuleSyntax` was the price of that**, and it was checked rather than
assumed. Pointing the components `tsconfig` at `utils/src` puts this repo's stricter compiler options on
that package's source, which raised twelve `TS1484` errors — imports of types that were not marked
`type`. They were marked, `utils/dist` was rebuilt, and the output is byte-identical to the build before
the change, so nothing about the published package moved.

**Vite's root is pinned in `playground/vite.config.ts`.** `vite preview` is started from the repo root by
the Playwright config, and without an explicit root Vite takes the working directory rather than the config
file's folder, which sends it looking for `dist` at the repo root rather than the Playground's. `root` is set from
`import.meta.url` so the config means the same thing wherever it is invoked from.

**`conventions.md`, `backlog.md` and `brief.md` moved to the repo root**, beside `CLAUDE.md`. They were in
`src/Lib` when that was the only tree with anything to say; they now describe three packages and a test
suite, so sitting inside one of them would be wrong.

### Samples live in the library

`components/src/Samples` holds what was `playground/src/App/Samples`: nine registries and the ~198 sample files
under them. The user's call, argued from what it buys rather than from where the files started — which is
where they started, before the Playground existed.

**What it buys.** The `@components` alias disappears, because a sample reaching `CellAnimation.utils` is now an
ordinary relative import inside one package, which also retires the DOM-test-environment question the alias was
parked on. The source view loses the whole sample-tab mechanism for free, since `components/src` was already
opaque to it. And a consumer imports a sample instead of copying it out of a page.

**A consumer pays only for what they name.** Every sample is re-exported individually from `index.ts`, so
`import { lineRow }` pulls one function and nothing else. Measured against the built `dist`, bundled with
esbuild, minified / gzipped: **5.7K / 2.4K** for one sample and its machinery, against **19.2K / 5.9K** for the
registry that names all sixty. This only works because _"a sample registry and the machinery that runs it are
separate modules"_ landed first — with the machinery still importing the lookup table there is no light path
to offer, and the move would have made every consumer pay for the whole collection.

**The two `plain` files are the one name that could not travel unchanged.** `Pattern/plain` and
`Gradient/plain` collide at the top level, so `index.ts` exports them as `patternPlain` and `gradientPlain`,
which is what the registries already called them internally. Every other sample is exported under its own name,
and the file-name-is-the-key rule is intact inside the registries.

**`SVGDefsSources` and `SVGDefsUri` did not go with them**, and are now
`playground/src/App/PageComponents/SVGDefsSources`. They are not samples: they render sample defs and serialise
them to a data URI so two `CellAnimation` examples have something to animate. That is Playground furniture by
the _"three trees"_ definition, it needs a DOM, and keeping it out of the library keeps page tooling off the
published surface. Its source tab still works, because it is Playground-side.

**What the tests did with the move.** The seven sample specs run under the library's Vitest now, in the same
plain-Node environment they always used — which was the alias's entire justification. Nothing about them
changed.

### How Samples is laid out

The user's restructure. Every registry is `<Component>/<Part>` — `CellAnimation/Weights`,
`Formation/Layouts`, `Staircase/Indents` — so the top level of `Samples` reads as a list of the components
that have samples, and a second part slots in beside the first without a folder having to be invented later.
Three of the four parents hold a single child, which is the point rather than an accident.

**Only the folder names are short; files keep their full names.** `CellAnimation/Weights/CellAnimationWeights.const.ts`
still exports `CellAnimationWeights`, and no name in the published API moved. The user's call between that and
shortening the files too, which would have broken the file-is-named-after-its-namespace rule for a folder depth
that already says `CellAnimation`.

**A middle `Samples/` layer is kept only where the samples are loose files.** `Weights` and `Keyframes` have
one because dropping it would strew sixty files in with the const, the types and the utils; `SVGDefs` lost its,
because its three sub-registry folders already do that job and a folder called `Samples` inside a tree called
`Samples` said nothing.

**What belongs in `Samples` at all, which is the line the restructure drew.** A sample is something a consumer
might plausibly reach for to get something working quickly. `MosaicImages` was not — the mosaic shapes and
their generated placeholders exist only to give one Playground page something to draw — so it left for
`playground/src/App/Pages/MosaicPage`, is exported from nowhere, and the page imports it as a local file.

### Layering

`Abstracts/` renders no DOM (namespaced utils, hook-like factories). `Fundamentals/` renders DOM.
`Composites/` combines Fundamentals. `Fundamentals/Input/` groups controls carrying a user-editable
value (see _"Folder layout"_ in `conventions.md`). `components/src/index.ts` enumerates every export path individually and stays
sorted — not a barrel.

**`Utils/typeUtils.ts` holds type transformers and nothing else.** Stated by the user: it is for things in
the shape of `Omit`, `Exclude` and `Pick` — generics that take a type and give back another one. Everything in
it qualifies (`MaybeAccessor`, `AccessorProps` and the three predicates behind them), as does `ss-utils`'
own `TypeScript/typeUtils.ts`, so nothing had to move. **Recorded because the next lone type has to land
somewhere else**: a union naming domain vocabulary is not a transformer, and putting one there would make the
file a miscellany rather than a category.

**`Abstracts/Anim` is gone, and `AnimDirection` with it.** One union, `"in" | "out"`, used by `ScreenWiper`
and `AudioSwitcher`. `Abstracts/` is things that render no DOM but do something — namespaced utils and
hook-like factories — and a lone type is neither, so the folder was a home of convenience. The two components
did mean the same thing by it, which was the argument for keeping it shared somewhere; the user's call went
the other way, and each now names its own: `ScreenWiperDirection` is exported beside `ScreenWiperShape`, and
`AudioSwitcher` holds a module-private `FadeDirection`. **Naming them rather than repeating a bare union is
what keeps the cost at zero** — a consumer writing an `onTransitionEnd` handler still has a type to import,
which was the only thing the shared version was buying.

**An `Abstract` is named for the thing that does the work, not for the activity.** The user's call, and a
breaking change taken deliberately while the library has one consumer. `Dismiss`, `Navigation` and `Rotation`
are `Dismisser`, `Navigator` and `Rotator` — folder, files, namespaces and the types hanging off them, so
`DismissStack` is `DismisserStack`, `NavigationGrid` is `NavigatorGrid` and `Rotation.createRotation` is
`Rotator.createRotator`. Renaming the type family too is what keeps a folder readable: a `DismissReason`
sitting beside a `DismisserStack` reads as two things rather than one, and the rule is worth more than the
sentence that one type name loses.

**The last two outliers took a suffix, and one of them turned out to deserve it.** `FocusUtils` is
`FocusManager`: it holds a module-level restore depth, decides whether a restore is in progress, traps focus
in a subtree and moves it on mount — state plus policy, which is an agent rather than a bag of functions, and
"focus manager" is the term the rest of the field already uses. The earlier verdict that it was a collection
was made without opening the file.

**`InteractionUtils` is `InteractionTracker`, and the arithmetic that made the name a lie went to
`ss-utils`.** Most of it tracks — `trackHold`, `trackDrag`, `trackSwipe`, `trackPageHidden`, and
`wrapElement`, which attaches listeners to report hover, press and focus flags. The four `computeSwipe*`
functions did not, so `GestureUtils` in `utils/src/Abstracts/gesture.ts` has them, along with `SwipeAxis` and
`SwipeDirection`. **The name is `Gesture` rather than `Swipe` on the user's call**: a package this small
should not gain a file per gesture, and pinch and drag arithmetic would otherwise each arrive asking for one.
`InteractionDragRatio` did not travel — the moved signatures take `Point2d`, which `ss-utils` already owns and
which that type was structurally identical to.

**The type family stayed on `Interaction`.** Unlike `Dismiss` → `Dismisser`, the subject noun here _adds_ a
word, so following the family through would have produced `InteractionTrackerSwipeDirection`. The line taken
instead: a flag or a reason belongs to the interaction, not to the thing watching it, so `InteractionFlags`,
`InteractionDragRatio` and `InteractionDragEndReason` keep their names. Recorded because it is a deliberate
exception to the rule directly above it, not an oversight.

**An acronym is not a subject either, so `FPS` went too.** It is `FrameRateMonitor`, and its factory is
`create` rather than `createMonitor`, which would have said monitor twice. The user's call between that and
`FrameCounter`: nothing the thing returns is a count — `{ current, average }` are both rates — so counting is
the mechanism rather than the subject, and `create` names what the code already called its own product. The
acronym left the signature with it: `getFPS` is `getFrameRate`, since keeping it would have left the thing
the rename was removing sitting in the return value. The Playground's on-screen label still reads `FPS`,
which is a display string and not an API.

**It also stopped being a `.utils.ts`.** `FPSUtils.createMonitor` returned reactive state, which is what
`Rotator.createRotator` and `DismisserStack.createLayer` do, and both of those live in a plain `.ts` exporting
the subject. A `.utils.ts` exports `<Subject>Utils` and holds functions; a factory for a live thing is not
that, so the file is `FrameRateMonitor/FrameRateMonitor.ts`.

**The rule reaches the abstract, not the components that use it.** A `Carousel` still has `getIsRotating`,
`renderRotationControl` and `CarouselRotationFlags`, because those are the carousel's own vocabulary for what
it does rather than references to the abstract. `RotationUtils` in `ss-utils` keeps its name for the same
reason from the other side: that package names a namespace `<Subject>Utils` and the subject there is the
arithmetic, not an agent.

**`Composites/` ships; `BinarySwitch` does not.** The composites were held back on the argument that a
composite demonstrates how Fundamentals combine rather than owning a contract, so shipping one freezes a
composition the consumer is better off writing, and that `Surface` being reachable from the Playground's
source was its whole audience. **The user reversed it**, so `Surface` and `SurfaceProps` are enumerated in
`index.ts` like anything else. What has not changed is the inside: `SurfaceSVG` and `SurfaceDiv` stay
unexported, because the wiring a composite assembles is not part of what it offers. `BinarySwitch` is still
internal because `Checkbox`, `Toggle` and `Radio` are its presets; only `BinarySwitch.types` ships. Stated
because a missing export reads as an oversight — it has been reported as a bug once.

### What goes to `ss-utils` and what stays here

Settled by the user, when `@internationalized/date` was taken as a dependency.

**`ss-utils` is bare: it implements logic on top of nothing.** That is the line, not "maths versus
layout". A primitive needing only the language belongs there. A module adapting a third-party package
to this library's shape stays here however mathematical it looks, because sending it would put a
dependency inside a package whose value is having none.

So `Abstracts/DateValue` wraps `@internationalized/date` from inside `components/src`. Pure formatting or
numeric helpers are candidates for `ss-utils`; anything importing the date package is not.

### What went to `ss-utils`, and what was weighed and kept

An extraction round ran: candidates were staged in a temporary `src/Extract`, the
user lifted what they wanted, the folder was removed. Recorded so the next round starts from the
argument rather than the survey.

**Left**: `Audio`, `ColorValue` (now `Color`, a namespace per colour space), `Decimal`, `Matrix3` (now
`Matrix3d`, over a `Point3d` rather than a tuple), `TimeValue` (now `TimeUtils`). `MathUtils` gained
`clamp`, `clamp01`, `normalize`, `lerp`, retiring sixteen hand-written `Math.min(Math.max(…))` clamps
across ten files — **nobody should write that expression again.** Four collapsed further to
`clamp01(normalize(…))`; `Progress` keeps its own guard, because its zero-span answer is `1` where
`normalize` reports `0`, and that choice is the caller's.

**`RotationUtils` went, whole, and is `utils/src/Abstracts/rotation.ts`.** It was listed below as a kept
candidate, and only `wrapIndex` was ever staked as qualifying — the rest reads as angular arithmetic in a
wheel's vocabulary. The user asked for the namespace, not the qualifying half of it, and the split would have
been worse than either whole: `getIndexAngle` calls `getStepAngle`, `getSpinAngle` calls `getIndexAngle`, so
half a namespace here and half there means a package boundary through the middle of one calculation. **The
line the "kept" list draws is about what a function needs, and every one of these needs only the language.**
What made them look component-driven is that their _documentation_ has to talk about wheels — which the
`utils/` doc rule now carries, in full, on all five.

`wrapIndex` did not go with them: it is `MathUtils.wrapIndex`, since wrapping an integer is not angular
arithmetic and `MathUtils` is where the sixteen hand-written clamps went for the same reason. It lost its
`stepCount` parameter name for `count` on the way, nothing about a ring of things being a step outside a
wheel. `CarouselUtils.wrapIndex` still exists and aliases it, so the published name a consumer already uses
did not move; `RotationUtils` is now published by `ss-utils` rather than by this package, and
`components/src/index.ts` no longer names it.

**`EasingUtils` went too**, but not out of this round — it was written for the move from the day it was
commissioned, and only the separate clone was holding it here. See _"`EasingUtils` went to `ss-utils` whole"_
below.

**Kept, with the shape each would need first.** The user's verdict: the remainder still feels
component-driven. Not outstanding work — the argument, so it is not re-derived.

- **`TextSyncUtils`** is ready as it stands: string and caret arithmetic, no DOM, and a mask engine is
  normally its own package. Needs a name that is not "syncing a text field".
- **`DismisserUtils.getIsWithinOwnedLayer`** is ARIA-aware DOM containment with nothing about dismissal
  in it; `DOMUtils` is where that belongs.
- **`AnchorUtils`** is "align one rect to another along an axis, in/out/center, then fall back to the
  variant that fits". `Rect`, `Bounds` and `Dir` already say that; the `AnchorHPlacement` vocabulary is
  the component-driven half, and dropping the word anchor **is** the abstraction. `getStackingBase`
  stays behind either way.
- **`ElementHighlightUtils.getSegmentRects`** computes the eight regions left when one rect is
  subtracted from another — general, except it returns CSS strings. Returning rects is the change, and
  it is why the function has no unit test: geometry cannot be asserted on a string.
- **`CellAnimationUtils`** is two things. `assignAnimationProps` writes ordered transforms and filters
  onto an element and already reads `CSSConst.ANIMATION_UNITS`, so it is the missing writer half of
  something that package owns; the four parity predicates are grid tiling and belong with the weights.
- **`SlideButtonUtils`** and half of **`CellAnimationWeightUtils`** mostly dissolved into `clamp01` and
  `normalize`. What is left of the first is a thumb sliding in a track, which is `SlideButton`'s.
- **`radar` and `spiral` should not go at all**: four multipliers named `cdoMul`, `croMul`, `cuoMul`,
  `cloMul` — real algorithms behind a signature only their one caller can read.

**Never staged, by category**: anything shaped around a component's own record (`SelectUtils`,
`TreeUtils`, `ToastsUtils`); anything bound to a framework (`InteractionTracker`, `FocusManager`, `FrameRateMonitor`,
`ElementFader`, the SVG defs modules that return JSX — the arithmetic that used to be tangled into them has
since moved to the Playground samples instead, so what is left here is markup and nothing else); anything adapting a
third-party package (`DateValue`, `Virtualizer` over `@tanstack/solid-virtual`); and three near misses
blocked only by a pure type sharing a file with Solid props — `NumberInputUtils`,
`RichTextUtils.parseContent`, `compileStops` / `sampleTrack`.

### Look in `ss-utils` before writing anything general-purpose

Asked for by the user. `ss-utils` is a dependency of this repo by the same author and already holds
a lot. Re-implementing something it exports is the easiest waste to commit and the hardest to notice,
because the duplicate works.

**The trigger is the shape of the code, not the name of the file.** Most utils start as three lines
inside a component, so "I am not writing a utility right now" is the wrong test. The real test:
**could this function be given a name and a couple of arguments and still make sense with nothing
around it?** If yes it is general-purpose, whatever file it is in. The user's example — comparing two
arrays by an id on each element — is not in `ss-utils` and is still that shape.

Aimed at the things that read as small enough to just write: clamping, rounding to a step, comparing
rects, spreading a padding, kebab-casing, picking a random element, deduplicating, formatting a number.
Several are already there — `MathUtils`, `RectUtils`, `CSSUtils`, `StringUtils`, `RandomUtils`,
`PolygonUtils`, `ShapeUtils`, `BitwiseUtils`, `FunctionUtils`, `DOMUtils`, `SVGUtils`, `IOUtils`,
`KeyframesUtils`, plus `Point2d`, `Vec2d`, `Vec4d`, `Rect`, `Bounds`, `Size2d`, `Dir` and `Count`.

**How to check, in order**: pick the namespace it would belong to; read that namespace's file under
`utils/src`, small enough to read whole; grep the export list for the noun
rather than the verb, since the package names things after what they operate on. Only then write it. If
genuinely absent, it is a candidate to go _to_ `ss-utils` — see the section above for which side of the
line it falls on.

### `EasingUtils` went to `ss-utils` whole

It is `utils/src/Abstracts/easing.ts`, and the arithmetic and its reasoning are documented there, as
everything in that package is. Two things about the move are this repo's to know.

**No alias was left behind, on the user's call.** `RotationUtils` kept a published name alive on its way out
only because `CarouselUtils.wrapIndex` already aliased it; there was no equivalent here, so anyone importing
`EasingUtils` from `@thewaver/ss-components` imports it from `@thewaver/ss-utils` instead. `Rotator` is the
only caller in this repo.

**It exports far more than has a consumer, and that is deliberate.** `Rotator` uses `ease` and nothing else;
the rest of the family exists because a package of easings missing two thirds of the set is one nobody reaches
for. **Do not prune it back to what this repo happens to call, and do not read the unused exports as dead
code.**

### Commands

```bash
npm start # dev server for the Playground
npm run build # utils first, then the components library: vite lib build + tsup .d.ts emit
npm run build:playground
npm run build:all # both of the above
npm test # vitest in all three packages
npm run verify:dom # playwright: build the playground, then drive it in a real browser
npm run format # prettier, 4 spaces, 120 cols, import sorting
npm run typecheck -w components # also -w utils, -w playground
```

Every script above is run from the repo root. A package's own scripts are reachable with `-w`, as in
`npm run dev -w components`, which is the watch build for anyone consuming `components/dist` directly.

### `external/` is a drop-zone, and every tool is told to leave it alone

The user's convention, from the second migration of code written elsewhere. Code to be brought in is dropped
in `external/` at the repo root, read, ported, and then deleted — but **the folder itself stays**, so the next
migration has somewhere to land.

**It is outside every tool, and the entry in `.gitignore` is what does most of the work.** Prettier 3 reads
`.gitignore` as well as `.prettierignore`, so one rule covers formatting and version control together and there
is no second list to keep in step — worth knowing, because `npm run format` is `prettier --write .` and would
otherwise reformat and re-sort the imports of code that has not been read yet. `tsconfig.json` and
`vitest.config.ts` name it as well: both already worked from a whitelist that could not reach it, and the
explicit exclusion is there so somebody looking for the rule finds it where they look.

**`external/*` with `!external/.gitkeep`**, rather than ignoring the folder, because git tracks files and not
directories: a plain `external/` entry would mean the folder does not exist in a fresh clone.

**The contents are nobody's contract.** They are a foreign framework's code, kept only long enough to read, so
none of the rules about `components/src` apply to them — not the comment ban, not the house style, not the export list.
Nothing in `src` may import from there.

### A file in transit sits commented out, rather than excluded in config

`components/src/JSXTextParser.utils.ts` is not this library's code and is not compiled. It is a copy of `ss-utils`'
parser carrying a fix that has to be applied in that repo, parked here so it survives a change of machine, and
**every line of it is commented out** — the user's instruction, and the reason is that the alternative leaves
litter: a `tsconfig.json` exclusion outlives the file it was written for, and the next person to read the config
finds a rule pointing at nothing. A commented file needs no rule at all, and one editor keystroke over a
select-all restores it.

**Line comments, not a block comment**, because the file carries `/** … */` documentation of its own and the
first `*/` inside would close the wrapper early.

**It is committed rather than ignored**, unlike `external/`, because the whole point is that it travels.

**Nothing is in transit now, and for `ss-utils` nothing can be.** The parser copy this was written for is
gone: the user applied its fix in `ss-utils` itself, so `utils/src/Web/JSX/Text/Parser/JSXTextParser.utils.ts`
is the corrected version, and a break the author wrote pushes unconditionally while only structural breaks
collapse. `ss-utils` sharing this repo means a fix that belongs to it is now made in place rather than
parked. The rule above stands for the next foreign file that needs somewhere to wait.

### Compatibility arguments cite `components/src` and nothing else

When arguing a modern CSS or JS feature is safe here, **only `components/src` counts** — it is the published
package and the only thing with a support contract, **with one carve-out: `components/src/Samples` does not
count.** It ships from the library now, but it is sample code a consumer copies or ignores rather than
component internals, and it was written to the Playground's old licence. `playground/src` is a harness;
citing either is not an argument.

**A use that carries a fallback is not evidence for a use that doesn't.** Relative colour syntax
appears 71 times in Samples and twice in `components/src`, both in `Composites/Surface/Surface.css.ts` and
both in vanilla-extract's array-value form — `backgroundColor: [fillColorVar, "rgb(from …)"]` — which
emits the plain variable first, so an engine that does not understand the newer syntax keeps a working
colour. That is graceful degradation, not a hard dependency. Check where the feature actually lives and
whether existing uses degrade; if the new code has no fallback, say so.

## Components

### Audit: the React-era `BinarySwitch`, and what of it survives here

A `_TEMP` copy of a two-year-old Preact implementation of these controls (a central
`BinarySwitch` base plus `Checkbox` / `Toggle` / `RadioButton` leaves, 568 lines) was read in full and
deleted — it referenced `@ui/*` and `preact` aliases, so `vite-plugin-checker` failed the build while it
sat in the tree.

**The base was the same idea from the other side**: a shell of a hidden native `<input>` plus a
`children` slot doing all the painting, parameterised by `type: 'checkbox' | 'radio'`. One difference
decides everything else.

**How the painter learns the state.** The old painters read state out of CSS through sibling selectors —
`input[type=checkbox]:checked + container &`, `:disabled + &`, `:focus-visible + &`. Free at runtime, and
uncarryable here for three stacking reasons:

- It hardcodes DOM adjacency. `CheckboxElement` renders the painter **first** and the input after it, so
  the input can be `inset: 0` over the painter and own the hit area and ring. The selector would point
  the wrong way, and fixing that fixes DOM order to the stylesheet forever.
- CSS only sees states the DOM has. `isPressed`, `hasError`, `isActive` and "disabled but reachable" are
  not DOM states, and disabled here is `aria-disabled`, so `:disabled` matches nothing — the old
  disabled and focus rules would silently do nothing.
- It puts library class names inside consumer paint. The settled model is the inverse: the library hands
  over data, the painter owns every pixel.

**`Toggle` needs no new library code**, the audit's most useful result. In the React tree `Toggle` was
141 lines and almost all paint: body size, handle size, radii, two translate distances computed in JS,
the colour swap on check. A toggle **is** a `Checkbox` whose painter draws a track and a sliding handle;
`isChecked` is the entire input it needs. The only library-side difference is one line of semantics —
`role="switch"` so it announces on/off rather than checked. So `Toggle` is a thin preset over `Checkbox`
in the `Surface`-over-`Shape` shape: not a new leaf, and not a base extracted from two leaves with
nothing to share.

**`Radio` is where a shared base earns its keep.** _Corrected after the fact: this originally continued
"and it is not the base `BinarySwitch` had", which was wrong. Only the group's state model and keyboard
needed somewhere new — they became `RadioGroup`. The leaf-sharing job was exactly what the old base was
for, down to the `type` parameter, and the shipped component keeps its name for that reason._

Old radio support was `type="radio"` plus `name`, leaving mutual exclusion to the browser. Too little
here, because the two things a radio group needs are behaviour, and behaviour is the shell's:

- A radio group is a **single tab stop**, arrows both moving and selecting — a roving tabindex, which
  `Tabs` already implements and is the model to follow.
- The **group owns one value**, not one boolean per radio. `checkedSignal: Signal<boolean>` is the wrong
  shape for a member of a set; a `RadioGroup` holding `Signal<T>` handing each radio a derived boolean is
  right. Native `name` grouping gets DOM mutual exclusion free but leaves the state model unowned.

**The size / config / token layer is inconsequent here, and it is the bulk of the code.** The three
`*.config.ts` files, the `s | m | l` scale, `BINARY_SWITCH_SIZE_REMAP`, derivations off
`uiCoreConfig.input.height`, `assignInlineVars` pushing per-instance colours, `useBackground` picking a
contrast pair, `hasOutline` switching filled versus outlined — all so the library can paint with values
the consumer chose. This library paints nothing. Port none of it. The `hasOutline` _technique_ (an empty
marker class selecting a variant) is already the idiom here.

**One genuine gap: the flags describe state, not events, and carry no pointer geometry.** The old
controls spawned a ripple on change imperatively through a controller ref, reading the element's width
and calling `controller.spawnEffect(x, y, …)`. `renderDecoration(getFlags)` is declarative and receives a
snapshot: a painter can watch `isActive` flip, but cannot know **where** the pointer was, and a one-shot
animation keyed on a boolean has nowhere to put an origin. The missing piece for ripples or any
positioned one-shot effect is the originating event, or coordinates from it, reaching the decoration
slot. Named now so it is not rediscovered as a styling problem; not worth building until asked for, and
opt-in when it is, or every control pays for a listener it ignores.

**Two smaller things, so they are not re-litigated.**

- _The `<label>` wrapper and `LabelContext`._ `BinarySwitch` wrapped itself in a `<label>` so clicking
  the painter toggled the input, reading a context to skip the wrapper when an ancestor `Label` supplied
  one (nested `<label>` is invalid). The hit-area half is solved better here: the input is `inset: 0`
  over the painter, so it **is** the hit target. The context half has no current need, but the pattern is
  worth remembering if a `Label` or `FormField` arrives — a component supplying a wrapper should let
  descendants detect it rather than making every caller pass "I am already labelled". Incidentally
  `<label disabled>` was never valid HTML and did nothing.
- _`hasOwnValue`._ A controlled-versus-uncontrolled mode flag: false force-wrote the DOM back to the prop
  and reported the inverse; true reported the DOM's checkedness. `checkedSignal` replaces the flag with
  one mechanism, so it should not come back. The force-write guards something real and became
  `syncElement` — see below.

### Controls: `BinarySwitch`, and `Toggle` / `Radio` as presets over it

Settled, immediately after the audit, which predicted most of this.

**`BinarySwitch` is a private shared composite, not a leaf and not public API**: `InteractionWrapper` plus
the hidden-native-input leaf plus change gating plus the single-writer DOM sync, parameterised by
`type: "checkbox" | "radio"`. `Checkbox`, `Toggle` and `Radio` are a dozen lines each on top. Checkbox and
Radio shared about nine tenths of their leaf, including `syncElement` — the one piece that must not be
copy-pasted, because the second copy is where the bug comes back.

It lives in `Fundamentals/Input/BinarySwitch/` and is **absent from `index.ts`**; only
`BinarySwitch.types` is exported, because `CheckboxProps` and `ToggleProps` alias
`BinarySwitchPresetProps` and the emitted `.d.ts` has to resolve it. A folder under `Fundamentals`
shipping no component is unusual and honest: it renders DOM so it is not an `Abstract`, and consumers
should reach for the presets so it is not public. Promoting it later is one line; the reason not to is
that a public `BinarySwitch` is the union of three controls and invites use over intent.

**One writer for the input's state.** No JSX `checked` binding. A single `syncElement` pushes
`element.checked = props.getIsChecked()` and `element.indeterminate = getIsMixed()` from state, called
from a render effect and again from `onChange` immediately after reporting.

The reason cost a bug to find: the browser flips `input.checked` **before** firing `change`. If the
owner's setter refuses the write — an optimistic toggle a server rejects, a "keep at least one selected"
rule, a form frozen mid-submit — the signal never changes, the render effect never re-runs, and the input
is left `checked` while state says otherwise. Nothing looks wrong then, because `appearance: none` means
the painter draws from the (correct) flags. The damage lands on the **next** click: the browser flips
back and reports the opposite of what the user did, and stays inverted.

`indeterminate` has the identical failure with a likelier trigger — the browser **clears** it on click,
and an effect keyed on an unchanged mixed value will not put it back, so a mixed checkbox would silently
stop being mixed. Hence both properties in one function.

This holds only while the owner's write is synchronous. A consumer `onChange` returning a promise is
awaited by nobody; an async accept would need the render effect to finish the job.

**`checkedState` is a flag, so the painter stops being told twice.** The flag arrived on
`ExternalInteractionFlags` and now sits on `BinarySwitchFlags`, with `InteractionWrapper` taking a matching
`getCheckedState`, which the presets `Omit` — they own the value, and two sources for one state is what the omission prevents. `PageCheckboxContent` / `PageToggleContent` / `PageRadioContent` now read `getFlags().checkedState` and take nothing
but flags. Before this, `CheckboxPage` passed `checkedSignal` to the component _and_ closed over the same signal for the
painter, with the component connecting neither: the faked linkage `renderDecoration(getFlags)` was
introduced to kill. Three states rather than two is also why it had to be a flag: mixed is computed by
the shell, so a painter inferring it from a boolean could not draw it.

**`CheckedState` is an abstract of its own, because a second control asked for it.** It was
`boolean | "mixed"` declared inside `BinarySwitch.types`; it is now
`Abstracts/CheckedState/CheckedState.types`, which `BinarySwitchFlags` imports like anyone else. The
standing _private until a second consumer_ rule fired the moment `Select`'s group header needed the same
three states — a header summarising a group of options is the same shape as a parent box summarising a group
of children, and two controls each declaring their own `boolean | "mixed"` would agree by luck rather than by
construction. It is a type and one fold, not a component, so it sits beside `DateValue` — the other abstract
that is a vocabulary rather than a behaviour — rather than under `Fundamentals`.

`CheckedStateUtils.fromMembers` takes the booleans and returns `true` only if every member is checked, `false`
only if none is, and `"mixed"` the moment they disagree. **An empty set is `false`, not `"mixed"`**: mixed means
_these disagree_, and nothing cannot disagree with itself; a group filtered down to no options would otherwise
paint a half-tick over an empty box. Elsewhere confirms the shape rather than the name — MUI's tree view
reports `"selected"` / `"indeterminate"` / `"unselected"` per item, and Ant Design's tree carries a
`halfChecked` list beside its checked one, both of which are this same three-way value spelled differently.

**Mixed is one-way and deliberately not part of the signal.** `getIsMixed` sits beside `getHasError`. A
user can never _click into_ mixed: it is a summary the owner computes (a parent box over disagreeing
children, a setting inherited elsewhere), and clicking always resolves it. Putting `"mixed"` in the
two-way signal would force every plain-checkbox consumer to handle a third case that only arrives from
their own code, and would let the component write a value the user cannot produce. `Radio` has no
`getIsMixed` and it is `Omit`ted: ARIA gives `role="radio"` no mixed state, and a radio that summarises
anything is a checkbox.

**A switch may not be mixed, so `Toggle` drops its role exactly while mixed.** ARIA disallows
`aria-checked="mixed"` under `role="switch"`, so the leaf computes
`role = isSwitch && !isMixed ? "switch" : undefined`, falling back to the native checkbox whose
`indeterminate` does map to mixed. A tri-state toggle announces as a mixed checkbox while mixed and as a
switch otherwise; the role flips on a state change, which readers re-announce anyway. The one place a
requested feature and the spec disagree, resolved by a role swap rather than an approximation.

**The group owns the value; each radio derives a boolean.** `RadioGroup` takes `valueSignal: Signal<T>`
and publishes a context; `Radio` takes `getValue` and reads `context.getValue() === props.getValue()`.
Per-radio `checkedSignal` was never on the table: a member of a mutually exclusive set does not own its
truth, and N booleans can represent states the group cannot be in.

Context rather than `Tabs`' count-plus-`renderOption` shape, because each radio keeps the whole
`InteractionWrapper` surface — its own tooltip, decoration, disabled and error state. A data-driven group
would grow a `compute*` prop per capability and re-expose all of them per index. The cost is
registration: `context.register(entry)` runs during each `Radio`'s setup and cleans up through the
caller's `onCleanup`, and the group sorts entries by `compareDocumentPosition` rather than trusting
registration order, so a reordered `<For>` cannot desynchronise keyboard order from the screen.

The context is typed `unknown` on the value, because a context cannot be generic; `Radio<T>` casts at the
boundary. Benign consequence: a `RadioGroup<SizeValue | undefined>` will accept a `Radio<string>`, and
only the group's own signal keeps the type honest.

**Native `name` grouping is used; native arrow-key navigation is not.** Every group generates a
`createUniqueId()` name unless given one, so the browser does DOM-level mutual exclusion. Its keyboard
handling cannot be used: disabled here is `aria-disabled`, so the browser sees no disabled radios and
would happily move to one **and select it**. `RadioGroup` `preventDefault()`s the arrows and walks
itself.

Its rule is one step more generous than either pattern alone: arrows move to the next entry that is
enabled **or** reachable-while-disabled, and select only if enabled. Single tab stop kept, disabled
options unselectable, and a disabled-but-reachable option can still receive focus so its tooltip
explains itself. `Home` / `End` jump to the ends of the same set. All four arrows work regardless of
`getDir`, which only drives layout.

This required `computeIsReachable` to move from `InteractionWrapper` into `InteractionTracker`, since
`Radio` computes the same predicate. Extracting rather than restating is the point: the predicate is
settled and two copies would drift. It does not re-expose reachability to a _leaf_ — `Radio` is a preset
one level above the leaf.

**`tabIndex` is now a conjunction, narrowing a previously absolute rule.** `wrapElement` takes an
optional `getIsTabbable` and computes `(!isDisabled || isReachable) && isTabbable ? 0 : -1`. The
wrapper's veto is still absolute; an ancestor owning a roving tab order can narrow it further. So the
`tabIndex` line still runs for every element, it just no longer decides alone. `getIsTabbable` stays
public on `InteractionWrapper` and is inherited by `Button` and `Checkbox`, because participating in
someone else's roving order is a general capability — unlike `getCheckedState`, which the presets own.

`InteractionWrapper` also gained a `ref` passthrough, since `RadioGroup` must `focus()` a specific radio.

**Known gaps, deliberate.** Arrow keys do not cross groups, and a group with every option disabled has no
tab stop at all — both correct, both look like bugs from outside. And **a caption drawn inside the painter
is not a label**: `PageRadioContent` draws its caption inside the painter under the `inset: 0` input, so
the whole row is clickable, which is legitimate but is not an accessible name and cannot place the caption
anywhere the painter does not reach. `Label` is the answer.

### Controls: `Label`

Settled, closing the gap the audit recorded.

**It wraps rather than points.** `Label` renders a `<label>` around both caption and control, so
association is implicit and no `id` is invented or threaded. `for` / `getId` was rejected: an explicit id
is a second thing to keep unique and in sync, and only earns its keep when the caption cannot be a
sibling of the control, which nothing here needs.

**It paints nothing, including the cursor.** Geometry only: `display: flex`, `width: fit-content`,
`getDir`, `getGap`. Cursor was left out deliberately: a `<label>` cannot know whether the control inside
is disabled, so a blanket `cursor: pointer` would lie, and taking `getIsDisabled` would duplicate state
the control owns. The caption is the consumer's child, so the cursor is theirs; the Playground sets it in
`pageStyles.labelCaption`.

**`aria-label` loses to a visible caption.** `Label` publishes a context and `BinarySwitch` reads it:
inside a `Label`, `getAriaLabel` is suppressed and a warning fires. Not a preference — `aria-label`
overrides the label's text as the accessible name, so a control carrying both is announced as something
other than what can be read, which is WCAG's _Label in Name_ failure. Suppressing rather than merging
keeps one visible source of truth; warning rather than failing silently is the house pattern.

That context is the audit's `LabelContext` idea put to better use, and it also does the original's job: a
`Label` nested inside a `Label` renders a `<div>`, since nested `<label>` is invalid and its activation
target ambiguous.

**A group caption is not a `Label`.** `RadioGroup` takes `getAriaLabel` and puts it on the
`role="radiogroup"` element. Wrapping a group in a `<label>` would claim one control is being named, and
would make a caption click activate an arbitrary member.

### Controls: `TextInput`

The first control whose element the user can see through, which turns out to be
the only thing separating it from `Checkbox`.

**The overlay geometry survives; what the input keeps does not.** Painter first in flow, `<input>` second
at `inset: 0` — the `CheckboxElement` arrangement, so the ring lands around what was painted. What
changes is the blank-slate rule: a text input **is** the thing showing the value, caret and selection. So
the reset keeps `appearance`, `background`, `border`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, `margin` and
`min-width` — all `!important` — and leaves `padding`, `font`, `color`, `caret-color` and the rest of the
text-drawing properties alone. `user-select: text` is set because `interactionRoot` sets `none`.

**Nesting the input inside the painter was the obvious alternative and lost on the focus ring.**
Typography would inherit and the padding duplication below would vanish, but the input is still the
focusable element, so the ring would be drawn around the inner text area rather than the frame, and
recovering it means the painter matching on `:has(:focus-visible)` — the arrangement rejected under
_"Nothing that fades or filters may touch the element that owns the focus ring"_. It would also make
`renderContent` a two-argument contract for one control.

**Accepted cost: the painter's inner padding and the input's `padding` have to agree, and nothing
enforces it.** Both are in the consumer's stylesheet, so a shared constant fixes it — the Playground's
`TextFieldContent.css.ts` derives both from `FIELD_PADDING`. The first place the painter does not own
literally every pixel, and the direct price of keeping the ring correct.

**`computeTextStyle` is the one place paint lives on the element the browser owns**, because there is no
other hook: the consumer must style the text, the text is inside the input, the input is the library's. It
takes `getFlags` per _"Render props receive what drives them"_ — disabled text is grey, and no ancestor
knows the flags.

It returns a **whitelisted** object rather than a class name:
`TextInputTextStyle = Pick<JSX.CSSProperties, "color" | "font-size" | "padding" | …>`. The first version
took `computeClassName` plus a prose rule ("only properties that draw text") that nothing enforced. A
`Pick` makes that a compile error, so a border or a `position` cannot decouple the painted box from the
wrapper's box. Solid's `JSX.CSSProperties` extends `csstype.PropertiesHyphen`, so keys are kebab-case and
lengths are strings — `"12px"`, not `12`.

**Applied as an inline style, which ends the specificity war on the consumer's side.** Inline styles
outrank every selector short of `!important`, so a consumer no longer reaches their input through a
`globalStyle` to beat an app stylesheet's `input:not([type="range"])`; the Playground lost four
`globalStyle` blocks. The library's own `!important` resets still win, correctly:
`caret-color` under `[aria-disabled='true']` must beat whatever the consumer asked for.

**One prop rather than one per property**, because almost everything that draws text is an _inherited_
property — `color`, `font-*`, `line-height`, `letter-spacing`, `text-align`, `text-transform`,
`caret-color`. Enumerating them reimplements CSS one prop at a time and still leaves a tail; one object
covers the tail by widening the `Pick`.

**Padding is deliberately _not_ whitelisted, because the library owns it.** The obvious division —
background element owns borders, corners and padding; input owns text — does not work: an absolutely
positioned box resolves `inset` against its containing block's padding box and **ignores that ancestor's
padding**, so padding on `renderContent` insets nothing. The first version whitelisted padding and made
the consumer compute it; `getPadding` and `getGap` replaced that (see below).

**What a value-only API cannot express**, recorded because it is why the class may have to come back:
`::selection`, `::placeholder`, `::-webkit-*` and `:autofill` are selectors, not values. The last is a
real gap — Chrome's `:autofill` forces an opaque background that `background: transparent` cannot clear,
so an autofilled field paints a solid square-cornered rectangle **over** the painter, and `color` is
locked the same way.

**Left alone deliberately, and not because it is hard.** The lock is anti-spoofing: Chromium refuses
author overrides so a site cannot conceal that the browser filled a field with stored data. Defeating it
is possible — `box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1000px <colour>` paints above the background and below the text,
and `-webkit-text-fill-color` covers the forced text colour — but doing it by default would suppress a
signal the browser is deliberately showing. `opacity` and `filter` are not alternatives at any
specificity: both composite the whole paint, fading text with background and reaching the ring. So no
escape hatch ships; if one is ever wanted it should be a narrowly documented pseudo-selector hook rather
than a general class prop, and the consumer should be the one deciding to override an anti-spoofing
default.

**`renderPlaceholder` is a slot, not a string.** Native `placeholder` is paint the library emits, which
_"A control paints nothing"_ forbids. The slot is `position: absolute; inset: 0; pointer-events: none`,
rendered between painter and input so typed text is never occluded, and **always rendered when the prop
is given** — gating on `isEmpty` internally would make a floating label impossible. The painter reads
`getFlags().isEmpty` and decides between hiding and floating. Placeholder text should be `aria-hidden`,
for the same reason a checkbox painter's glyph is.

This is also why the slot belongs to the leaf rather than `renderDecoration`: the decoration wrapper sits
above the input and is shared by every control, whereas a placeholder must sit below the caret and only a
text field has one.

**Focus is drawn once, by the ring, and a painter must not draw a second one.** The first
`PageTextFieldContent` coloured its border on `isFocused`, producing two concentric indications at
different radii. The outline already hugs the painted box exactly, so there is nothing left to add.
`isFocused` stays available for focus-driven paint that is **not** a ring.

**Adornments are `renderLeading` / `renderTrailing`, and they are the leaf's.** Both absolutely
positioned against the root at `insetBlock: 0`, both rendered **after** the input so they stack above it.
Width is their content's, so the slot hugs what it holds and clicks either side still land on the field.
The Playground puts a real `Button` in one: an adornment can hold anything, including another
`InteractionWrapper` with its own ring, tooltip and disabled state.

**The slot inherits `pointer-events: none` from the root and must not override it.** It briefly set
`auto`, which inverted hover: the slot sits above the input, so pointing at a static adornment stole the
hit test, the input never received `mouseenter`, and `isHovered` went **false** exactly while the cursor
was over the adornment. Inheriting `none` lets the hit test fall through, and hovering the adornment
reads as hovering the field, which is what it is.

Interactivity is unaffected, which is why `none` is the right default rather than a compromise:
`pointer-events` is inherited, so an interactive element re-enables it for itself, and every control
element here already does (`buttonElement`, `binarySwitchElement`, `textInputElement` all set
`pointer-events: all`). Only raw consumer markup that must be clickable needs `pointer-events: auto`, the
same one-liner `interactionDecorationWrapper` always required.

One consequence, left alone: hovering an interactive adornment drops the field's `isHovered`, since the
adornment is a sibling of the input and `mouseleave` fires. That reads correctly — you are hovering the
button — and fixing it means moving `wrapElement`'s hover tracking to the root and to `mouseover` /
`mouseout`, which is shared-code surgery for a cosmetic gain.

They do not go through `renderDecoration` because that slot is one full-box overlay shared by every
control, while these are positional, text-specific and drive the input's padding. Nor are they one prop
taking a side — _"one slot, not layered slots"_ was about stacking, and these reserve opposite ends.

Named leading/trailing for **role, not axis**. They were briefly positioned with `inset-inline-start` /
`inset-inline-end` on the argument that following the writing direction costs only a property name; that
argument is withdrawn. Adopting `CSSPadding` made it incoherent, since `paddingLeft` is physical and
feeding it into a logical property is a lie the moment anything is RTL. Physical throughout is honest
while nothing else in the library is RTL-aware — `getDir` on `Label` and `RadioGroup` means flex
direction, not writing direction. Going RTL later means changing the CSS, not the prop names.

**The field's inset is measured, not declared.** `getPadding` and `getGap` are what the consumer states;
everything else is derived. `getPadding` takes `CSSPadding | number`, normalised through
`CSSUtils.spreadPadding`, so one number spreads to four sides and per-side control needs no second prop.
`CSSUtils.spreadableToStyle` renames the keys and adds the `px`, so no template strings are built by
hand. It briefly took a bare `number`, and briefly used `Bounds` — the right shape for
`createViewportRectObserver`, which measures _edges_, while `CSSPadding` arrives keyed by CSS property.

Each adornment slot is observed by a local `createAdornmentWidth`, and the input's text area is inset by
`padding + (adornment ? adornmentWidth + gap : 0)` per side, applied as an inline style along with the
same inset on the placeholder slot. The slots themselves sit at `padding` from their edge. So the only
numbers anyone writes are padding and gap, and the placeholder need not know an adornment exists.

_Corrected after the fact: this section originally argued that an adornment reserves no space and the
consumer supplies matching padding, since measuring "buys correctness with a resize observer per field
and takes the decision away from the painter". The decision it takes away is one the painter cannot make
correctly — the strongest counter is **i18n**, where `Show` / `Hide` becomes `Anzeigen` / `Verbergen` and
any declared width silently breaks, along with font swaps and dynamic adornment content._

**A `ResizeObserver` specifically, not a measured rect.** `createViewportRectObserver` is a
`requestAnimationFrame` loop, right for a position that moves and far too heavy for a width that changes
rarely. `borderBoxSize` also reports **untransformed layout size**, which matters because the Playground
runs inside `Viewport`'s `transform: scale()` and `getBoundingClientRect` would return scaled values —
the whole reason `ViewportUtils.getAdjustedBoundingClientRect` exists. `offsetWidth`, used for the
initial synchronous read so the first paint is already inset, is likewise transform-free.

No feedback loop is possible while adornments stay absolutely positioned: the input's padding cannot
change an adornment's size. `getMinWidth` derives the **root's** size from the same measurements and is
safe for the same reason. Anything making an adornment's width depend on the root's would close the loop.

**`getMinWidth` is the floor, and it is the same numbers summed.** `InteractionWrapper` gained
`getMinWidth` beside `getSizing`; `TextInput` feeds it `leadingInset + trailingInset`, which expands to
`padding × 2 + adornment widths + gap × adornment count` — exactly the chrome. Below that the field draws
over its own adornments. It reserves nothing for the text: a zero-width text area is a legitimate floor,
and picking a minimum number of visible characters would be the library inventing a design decision.

This is why the measurement lives in `TextInput` rather than `TextInputElement`: `min-width` belongs on
the root, the root belongs to `InteractionWrapper`, and props flow down. The leaf receives `getTextInset`
and `getSpreadPadding` ready-made and is correspondingly dumber.

**What `getMinWidth` does not do: make the painter follow.** It protects the root, the input and the
adornments. A painter with a fixed `width` stays put, so if the floor exceeds it the root grows and the
frame is narrower than the field it frames. Guaranteeing they move together needs `flex-grow: 1` in
`interactionRoot > *`, which would change every control at once — not worth doing on `TextInput`'s
account. Until then the rule is that a painter must not be narrower than its own adornments require.

**It is a local helper in `TextInput.tsx`, not an `Abstracts` utility.** It briefly was
`ElementObserver.createLayoutSizeObserver`, which put a second unrelated thing in a namespace whose name
then had to work harder, and shipped public API for one internal caller. Both instances live in one file.
Same rule as `TextArea` below: extraction is cheap, the wrong base is not, and the trigger is a second
component wanting it.

One correct-but-odd consequence: the focus ring encloses the adornments, because they are inside the
field's box. An adornment that should own its ring is a `Button` in the slot, and it gets one.
`interactionRoot > * { margin: 0 !important }` reaches the slots, which is the rule doing its job — a
consumer insets an adornment with margin or padding on their own content, one level down.

**Disabled means `readonly`, the first control where `preventDefault` could not do the job.** "Activation"
for a text field is typing, pasting, dragging text in, autofill and IME composition, with no single event
to cancel. `readonly` blocks every one and satisfies the constraints that forced the `aria-disabled`
rule: the element stays focusable, its events keep firing so a disabled-but-reachable field still reveals
its tooltip, and — decisively — **the UA does not repaint a readonly input**, so appearance parity holds
for free. Selection and copying survive, which native `disabled` would have killed.
`element.readOnly = isDisabled || isReadOnly`.

**The caret is suppressed while disabled, and only while disabled.** A disabled-but-reachable field is
focusable by design, and the browser draws a blinking caret in a `readonly` input — an invitation to type
that the field will refuse. `caret-color: transparent` on `[aria-disabled='true']`, with `!important`
because a consumer's `caret-color` reaches the input through `computeTextStyle`. Read-only keeps its
caret, since keyboard navigation and selection inside it are the point.

Read-only is a real feature, so `getIsReadOnly` is public, `aria-readonly` reflects only the consumer's
intent and `aria-disabled` reflects disabled. There is deliberately **no redundant JS guard on the input
path** — `readonly` is the single mechanism and a browser cannot deliver an `input` event past it. The
mouse handlers keep explicit gating, because `readonly` does not suppress `mouseenter` / `mouseleave`.

**Native constraint validation stays out.** `required` / `pattern` produce a UA-painted bubble, which is
paint the library would be emitting; `hasError` is the owner's. `maxLength` is out for a different reason:
the owner's setter owns transforms, and an attribute that truncates silently would be a second mechanism.

**`syncElement` is `BinarySwitch`'s function with two problems `BinarySwitch` never had.** Same premise —
the browser mutates `value` before `input` fires — except on every keystroke rather than a rejected
toggle.

- **Assigning `value` collapses the caret to the end.** The sync captures `selectionStart` /
  `selectionEnd`, writes only when `element.value` actually differs, and restores; the accepted path
  therefore never touches the selection. The `null` guard is load-bearing: `type="email"` and
  `type="url"` do not support the selection API, so the properties read `null` and `setSelectionRange`
  would throw. Truncation needs no special case — `setSelectionRange` clamps.
- **Writing mid-composition destroys it.** An `isComposing` signal gates both the sync and the report,
  and `compositionend` reports and re-syncs. Chrome and Firefox fire `input` after `compositionend` while
  Safari has historically fired it before; running the report from both is idempotent.

Both are read inside the render effect, so ending a composition re-syncs on its own.

_Corrected after the fact: that re-sync is real, and in the original ordering it destroyed the commit._
`handleCompositionEnd` cleared the composing flag **before** reporting. Clearing it re-runs the render
effect synchronously, `syncElement` finds `element.value` holding the text the IME just committed and
`getValue()` holding the pre-composition state, and writes the stale state over it — after which
`reportValue` reads the clobbered element and reports the old string. Composing `にほ` into `Ada` and
committing `日本` left both DOM and state at `Ada`. The report now runs first and the flag flips after, so
the re-sync finds nothing to write; a refusing or transforming owner still gets its correction one step
later. Found by the first run of the interaction suite, which is the whole argument for having one — the
ordering reads as correct and nothing about it is visible in markup.

**Transforms compose through `onInput`, not through a derived signal.** `TextInput` writes `valueSignal`
with the raw value then calls `onInput`, exactly as `Checkbox` writes `checkedSignal` before reporting, so
a consumer wanting upper-casing or digits-only writes the signal a second time from `onInput` and the sync
corrects the DOM. Handing `TextInput` a hand-built `[getter, transformingSetter]` pair was abandoned:
Solid's `Setter<T>` is an overloaded type a plain `(value: string) => void` cannot satisfy, so it needs a
cast at every call site to express what the sanctioned path already does.

**`isEmpty` and `isReadOnly` join the flags, now a trend rather than an exception.** Both follow
`checkedState`: added to `ExternalInteractionFlags`, exposed as `getIsEmpty` / `getIsReadOnly`, and
`getIsEmpty` `Omit`ted from `TextInputProps` because the component owns the value. `getIsReadOnly` stays
public. The painter does **not** receive the value: the input already renders it, and a painter drawing it
too would double it. `isEmpty` is the summary driving placeholder and floating-label paint, nothing more.
The cost is in `backlog.md` — `ExternalInteractionFlags` is on its way to being the union of every
control's private state.

**`number` is a type, not a component.** _Corrected after the fact: this originally argued for a separate
`NumberInput`, because writing `String(state)` back on every keystroke makes `"1."`, `"-"` and `"1e"`
untypeable and `setSelectionRange` throws on `type="number"`. Both claims are true, and neither was a
reason for a component._ The argument rested on an unstated assumption: that a number field means
`valueSignal: Signal<number | undefined>`. It does not. **The DOM's value is a string for every input
type**, and with `Signal<string>` the round-trip never happens — `syncElement` compares strings, finds
them equal, writes nothing. The `setSelectionRange` hazard was already handled by the `null` guard written
for `email` and `url`.

So `"number"` is a member of `TextInputType`, and it needed three behavioural attributes (`getMin` /
`getMax` / `getStep`, driving arrow-key stepping) and one CSS rule suppressing the spin buttons, which are
UA paint. Consumers who want a number derive it from the string.

This generalises: **an HTML input type is not a reason for a component.** `Toggle` was not one because its
difference was paint; `number` is not one because its difference is an attribute. What earns a component
is behaviour the shell has to own — which `RadioGroup` had and neither of these did.

**One caveat `type="number"` carries and the library cannot repair.** During bad input — a lone `"e"`,
`"-"`, `"1e"` mid-typing — the HTML value sanitisation algorithm makes `element.value` return `""` while
the field still shows the characters. State and screen diverge, nothing in the DOM exposes the visible
string, and `syncElement` sees two empty strings and correctly does nothing. The visible symptom is
`isEmpty` reporting true with text on screen, so a `renderPlaceholder` overlay draws over it.
`type="text"` with `getInputMode={() => "decimal"}` avoids it and is better wherever the placeholder or an
exact value matters.

**Password is not a component.** Its only distinguishing behaviour is revealing, which is `getType`
flipping between `"password"` and `"text"` over a signal the consumer owns — the audit's "`Toggle` needs
no new library code" result again. The Playground demonstrates it with a `Toggle` beside the field.

**`LabelUtils.resolveAriaLabel` was extracted rather than copied.** The context read, the suppression and
the warning lived inline in `BinarySwitchElement` and are needed identically here — the
`computeIsReachable` situation, so it moved to `Label.utils.ts` under the same namespace idiom, and the
warning lost its `BinarySwitch:` prefix.

**The shared composite this section predicted is `TextField`** (below). Everything settled here still
holds, one file down, and `TextInput` is a dozen lines on top of it.

### Controls: `TextField` extracted, with `TextInput` and `TextArea` as presets

Settled, on the terms `TextInput` had already written down: a private shared leaf
parameterised by its element, presets that `Omit` what does not apply, in the `BinarySwitch` shape — and
**not** a `"textarea"` member of the type union, which would be a type that silently changes the element.

**Nothing about `TextInput` changed except where it lives.** `Fundamentals/Input/TextField/` holds the
base; `TextInput` is `<TextField {...props} getElement={() => "input"} />` and `TextArea` the same with
`"textarea"`. The base is absent from `index.ts`; only `TextField.types` ships. The types moved with it
and the old names are gone rather than aliased: `TextFieldFlags`, `TextFieldTextStyle`, `TextFieldType`,
`TextFieldMode`. `Select` imports the text style from the base, and the Playground's painters were renamed
— `PageTextFieldContent` / `PageTextFieldPlaceholder` / `PageTextFieldAdornment` — since one painter now
serves three shells.

`TextSync` widened to `HTMLInputElement | HTMLTextAreaElement`, exported as `TextSyncElement`. Both carry
`value`, `selectionStart`, `selectionEnd` and `setSelectionRange`, so the caret restore is unchanged
rather than branched.

**The element is a `Dynamic`, and that is the whole parameterisation.** One attribute list, with the two
element-specific attributes computed: `type` is `undefined` on a textarea, `rows` on an input. This also
tightened `min` / `max` / `step`, now emitted only for `type="number"` — the browser ignores them
elsewhere, but a `type="text"` field carrying them is a lie in the DOM, and `NumberInput` is a
`type="text"` field that owns a range.

**Auto-growing height is opt-in, and the only thing that could not be inherited.** A fixed textarea leaves
the settled arrangement untouched: the painter sizes the box, the element covers it, `rows` is beside the
point. An auto-growing one inverts that — content decides the box — and the resolution keeps the inversion
out of the overlay and puts it on the wrapper. `getIsAutoSizing` turns it on, `getMinRows` (default 2, the
native default) is the floor, `getMaxRows` the optional ceiling.

The measurement mirrors `getMinWidth` one axis over. `InteractionWrapper` gained `getMinHeight`;
`TextField` sets the element's `bottom` to `auto` for one frame, reads `scrollHeight`, restores it, and
clamps against the row floor and ceiling. `scrollHeight` includes the element's padding and the element
has no border, so the number _is_ the root height needed. `bottom` is the only property touched, because
the class already carries `height: auto !important` and an absolutely positioned box with `top`, `bottom`
and `height: auto` takes its height from the insets. Nothing Solid writes as an inline style is disturbed.

**A growing root only moves the painter if the painter lets it.** The root is `display: flex` with
`align-items: stretch`, so a painter declaring no height follows the root. Same limitation `getMinWidth`
records, load-bearing in the other direction: an auto-sizing `TextArea` wants a painter with no height, a
fixed one wants a painter that sets one. The Playground says which through `getIsStretched` / `getHeight`
on its own painter.

Two smaller consequences. **The re-measure listens for width, not height**, because publishing a height
the observer then reads back is a loop; it compares `inlineSize` against the last one and returns early.
And **`overflow-y` is `hidden` while growing uncapped**, so no scrollbar flickers in during the frame
between a keystroke and the new floor, and `auto` otherwise.

**`resize` is `none`, deliberately without `!important`.** A user-dragged element would decouple the
element's box from the painted box. The other resets carry `!important` because a real conflict was
observed; no such selector exists for this property — a bare `textarea { resize }` is weaker than a class
and loses already. Escalating on suspicion is the defensive habit that rule warns against.

### Controls: `NumberInput`, and the first preset that earns a codec

This does not reopen _"`number` is a type, not a component"_ — it passes that
test. Four things a consumer would otherwise write per field, none of them an attribute: the ladder
stepping walks, clamping when the field is left rather than per keystroke, refusing characters that cannot
appear in a number, and the string-to-number codec.

**It is a `type="text"` field**, which the caveat above already recommends: under `type="number"` the
sanitisation algorithm makes `element.value` return `""` during half-typed input, so `isEmpty` lies and a
placeholder overlay draws over what was typed. A field whose job is to own a number cannot afford that.
What the browser stops providing — spin buttons, arrow stepping, the spin-button role — the shell
provides.

`getIsSpinButton` on `TextFieldState` is exactly the `getIsSwitch` shape: the base computes
`role="spinbutton"` and publishes `aria-valuenow` / `aria-valuemin` / `aria-valuemax` from the value and
range it already holds. `aria-valuenow` is omitted while the text does not parse.

**`valueSignal` is `Signal<number | undefined>`, and `undefined` means an empty field.** The one place the
`Signal<string>` rule is deliberately broken, because the codec is the feature. A private `Signal<string>`
still runs the element, so the `"1."` hazard is untouched — the string signal is what `TextSync` compares
and the number is never written back over it. `undefined` rather than `0`, because a `0` would be a value
the user did not type.

**Typing is refused character by character rather than parsed and rewritten** — the transforming-setter
idiom moved inside the control. `NumberInputUtils.sanitizeText` keeps a character only where it can legally
appear: one sign at the front, one more after an exponent, one decimal point, one exponent and only after a
digit. Written to keep half-typed values typeable rather than to accept only complete numbers: `-`, `1.`,
`1e` and `1e-` all survive, each reporting `undefined` upward until it parses.

**Clamping happens on blur, not on input.** Per keystroke it makes the second digit untypeable — with a
minimum of 40, typing `5` becomes `40` before the `0` arrives. Stepping still clamps immediately, because
a step is a complete gesture and typing is not.

**And an out-of-range number is reported to nobody until the field settles.** Blur-clamping alone was not
enough, because it only governs the text: the number still went out on every keystroke, so a duration field
with a floor of 100 handed its consumer `5`, then `50`, and restarted the animation twice at durations nobody
asked for. What holds the range now is silence — while the text parses to something the range refuses, the
`valueSignal` and `onInput` are left alone and the owner keeps the last reading that was allowed. Leaving the
field clamps and reports, as before, so the value an owner sees is only ever one it could have been given.

**`undefined` is still only "empty", and out-of-range is held rather than reported as `undefined`.** An owner
cannot afford the two to be one answer: `undefined` is what it acts on to mean "nothing was entered", and
holding needs no third state to say the rest. `CurrencyInput`, `DateInput` and `TimeInput` reported `undefined`
for a figure or a date their codec refused, which is the same fault a level down; `MaskedField` holds too now,
so all four controls agree — see _"a value the codec refuses"_ in the `MaskedField` entry.

**The field says so itself**, `hasError` ORing the range issue into whatever the owner passed, the same line
`CurrencyInput` writes. It shows immediately rather than on blur, matching a native number field: `:invalid`
tracks the value, so it follows `rangeUnderflow` from the keystroke that causes it — waiting for the field to
be left is what the separate `:user-invalid` is for, and a control that reports nothing meanwhile owes the
person typing the reason straight away.

**Stepping, `Home` / `End` and the stepper's end flags read the text, not the reported value.** They used to
read `valueSignal`, which was the same thing while every keystroke was reported and is not any more: with
`999` typed into a field capped at 100 and the owner still holding `99`, an arrow would have stepped from the
`99` nobody can see. The text is what the field holds; `valueSignal` is what the owner has accepted.

**The fault this came out of was one level out, in the Playground's own panel adapter.** `PageNumberField`
brought every keystroke into range before storing it, and the mirror then wrote the stored number back over
the text — so with a floor of 100, pressing `5` to begin `500` left `100` in the field and the `0`s appended
to that. It also reported twice, once through the mirror's setter and once through `NumberInput`'s `onInput`.
Both are gone and the adapter now guards nothing, because the control does.

**The general rule is that an owner may not correct a value a control reports mid-gesture.** A mirror is two
sides that both write: the control writes what was typed, the owner writes what it decided to store, and
anything the owner changes on the way in comes back over the text on the way out. Clamping, rounding and
normalising are one shape here, and none of them is safe per keystroke. Where a control defines the moment a
value settles, a correction belongs at that moment or nowhere — and a control that can be handed a reading it
refuses should refuse it itself, rather than leaving every owner to remember not to.

**The step ladder counts from `min`, not from zero**, matching a native number field: a value on a rung
moves a whole step, one between rungs snaps to the next rung in the direction of travel. `computeStep`
runs the arithmetic in whole units of the smallest decimal in play rather than in floats, so `0.1` from
`0.3` gives `0.4` and no epsilon has to be chosen. Pure function in `NumberInput.utils.ts` with tests.

**The stepper reaches the painter through `renderTrailing`, widened rather than duplicated.**
`NumberInput` re-declares that slot as `(getFlags, stepper)`, the same widening `InteractionTooltipDefs`
does. A second `renderStepper` slot loses: both want the same physical position, and one slot lets a
painter draw a unit and a stepper together. The `stepper` carries `stepUp` / `stepDown` plus `getIsAtMin` /
`getIsAtMax`, so a painter can disable the end of the range it has reached — flags stay pure state, actions
stay out of them.

**`onKeyDown` and `onBlur` exist on `TextFieldCbs` and are `Omit`ted from both public presets.** The
arrows, `Home` / `End` and the blur-clamp need them, and the base is where they belong; whether `TextInput`
should expose them is a separate question, and answering it as a side effect would be smuggling.

**`untrack` on the mirror is the fix for a real flip-flop, not a micro-optimisation.** The effect
restating the text when the owner writes a new number must read the text _untracked_. Tracked, it also
re-runs when the text changes — and `TextField` writes the raw text into the signal before the preset's
`onInput` sanitises it, so for one moment the text says `"1"` and the number still says `undefined`. A
tracked effect fires in that gap, formats `undefined` back to `""`, and the two fight: the observed
symptom was a caret jumping to the start and digits arriving in reverse. The `ImageSwitcher` shape — an
effect whose job is one-directional must only depend on the direction it syncs from.

### Controls: `Range`

`backlog.md` predicted this would be the most architecturally novel control left
and got the central call wrong, which is the most useful thing to record.

**A two-thumb range _is_ two native `<input type="range">` elements, one per thumb.** The prediction was
that two thumbs had nowhere to go under overlay geometry, so both thumb counts would be custom. Each thumb
is its own input, absolutely positioned `inset: 0` over the same painter, so a pair is the single case
rendered twice and the two modes cannot diverge in paint, keyboard or ARIA. Native also keeps `step`,
`Home`/`End`, `PageUp`/`PageDown`, drag and the track-click jump.

`Range` therefore did **not** need `backlog.md` #2's pointer primitive, and item 1 stays open for the
thing that does — a two-dimensional colour surface, which has no native equivalent.

**Crossing is prevented by the inputs' own `min` and `max`, not by JS.** Thumb `n`'s `min` is thumb
`n-1`'s value and its `max` is thumb `n+1`'s, so the browser clamps drag and keypress identically and no
guard can be forgotten. The cost is the tie: two thumbs on the same value cannot move through each other,
so which one you grab decides which way you can go. `raiseNearestThumb` resolves that on `pointermove` —
the input nearest the pointer gets `z-index: 1`, and on an exact tie the side of the pointer decides.
Verified in a browser with both thumbs at 80.

**Ranking has to happen on `pointermove`, before the press.** `pointerdown` is too late — the browser has
already picked the event target and begun its native drag. The move handler is skipped while a button is
held (`e.buttons === 0`) so a drag in progress cannot be stolen.

**The library owns the thumb's hit size; the painter owns its appearance.** `appearance: none` leaves the
thumb with no size in Chromium, which kills dragging, so `Range.css.ts` styles
`::-webkit-slider-thumb` and `::-moz-range-thumb` — transparent, sized from `getThumbSize`. That number
and the painter's visible thumb must agree and nothing enforces it: exactly `TextInput`'s
padding-versus-inset cost, paid the same way with one shared `RANGE_THUMB_SIZE` constant.

It is also why the painter is handed `ratios` rather than percentages. A thumb's centre travels between
`thumbSize / 2` and `length - thumbSize / 2`, never the full track, so `left: ratio%` would overhang both
ends. The painter positions with `calc(ratio * (100% - thumbSize))`, which it can only write because it
knows the thumb size.

**One prop per mode, and giving neither or both warns.** `valueSignal: Signal<number>` drives one thumb;
`rangeSignal: Signal<RangeValues>` drives a pair. A single `Signal<number | RangeValues>` would force
every plain-slider consumer to narrow a union on every read, and a generic would hit the `AccessorProps`
hole. Mode is structural rather than a `getMode` prop because the value's shape carries it.

**The selection is `{ start, end }`, and the scale keeps `min` / `max`.** The pair's fields were `min` /
`max` for one draft, which collided badly: `getMin` would be the floor of the track while
`rangeSignal[0]().min` was the floor of the selected band. `getMin` / `getMax` match the native attributes
and `TextInputState` already uses them.

`start` / `end` over `from` / `to` on published precedent rather than taste. Adobe's React Spectrum
`RangeSlider` takes `{ start, end }`; MUI's prose describes its array as "the start and end of a range";
Radix is `number[]` and offers no names. The only major library with other names is Ionic's
`{ lower, upper }`, whose type is the single union this component avoided. Nothing checked uses `from` /
`to` for a slider — that reads as a date-range and filter idiom.

`RangeValues` and `RangeSpan` are the same shape on purpose: the selection is in scale units and
`flags.fill` is the same span as 0..1 ratios.

**Disabled refuses the write and pushes the element back.** A range has no `readonly`, so the guard is
the `BinarySwitch` shape: the browser moves the thumb before firing `input`, so a refused value is
overwritten by `syncElement`. Both paths run it, since the accepted path is also where an owner may clamp.

**Vertical is `writing-mode: vertical-lr` plus `direction: rtl`, with no fallback — accepted.**
The `direction` puts the low value at the bottom. Per MDN, vertical form controls via `writing-mode` "only
gained full browser support in 2024", and this is `components/src`, so the baseline was put to the user and taken.
The older routes could not have been layered underneath anyway: `appearance: slider-vertical` cannot
combine with the `appearance: none` that strips UA paint, and Firefox's `orient="vertical"` is
non-standard. On an older engine a vertical `Range` renders horizontal rather than degrading.

The first hard modern-CSS dependency in `components/src` with no fallback, so it is the precedent
_"Compatibility arguments"_ will be cited against. It is a real one: argued from a dated support claim and
sanctioned explicitly, not inferred from the Playground.

### Controls: `Tabs` as records, and the shape a data-driven group has to take

Settled, as the rehearsal for `Select`. `Tabs` predated the control model and was the last
component contradicting it: it hand-rolled its `<button>` / `<a>` and set native `disabled`. It is now
`InteractionWrapper` per item plus an unexported `TabsItem` leaf, in the `Button` shape.

**Parallel arrays became one array of records.** `getTabCount` + `getHrefs` + `computeIsDisabled` were
three sources indexed against each other; now `getTabs: Accessor<Tab<T>[]>` with
`Tab<T> = { value, href?, isDisabled? }`. This answers the objection recorded under `RadioGroup` — that
data-driven groups "grow a `compute*` prop per capability and re-expose all of them per index". True of
_indexed callbacks_, not of data: a capability is a field, and adding one costs nothing at the call site.
The earlier entry rules out the callback form only.

**Identity is the value, never the position.** `getSelectedIndex` / `onSelectionChange(index)` became
`getSelectedValue` / `onSelectionChange(value)`. An index is stable only while the list is, and a filtered
or searchable group changes exactly that. Everything internal resolves through the value and treats the
index as a lookup result.

**`<Index>`, not `<For>`, and that is why `renderTab` takes an accessor.** Records are rebuilt on every
filter keystroke, so `<For>`'s by-reference keying would remount every row, losing focus and every ref.
`<Index>` keys by position and lets the record change under a stable node, so the painter must subscribe:
`renderTab(getTab, getFlags)`. The one place the choice of list primitive dictates a prop's shape.

**Refs replace `querySelectorAll`.** The old `:scope > a, :scope > button` walk could not survive the
wrapper, option groups or a painter rendering a `Button`. Each slot reports its control element through
`InteractionWrapper`'s `ref`, so the element list is keyed by the same index as the data. Registration in
the `RadioGroup` sense is unnecessary: the group already owns the array.

**Selection stays one-way, and this is where `Tabs` and `RadioGroup` legitimately differ.** `RadioGroup`
takes `valueSignal` because it owns its value; a `Tabs` with `hrefs` does not — selection is derived from
the route, the case _"Signal tuples for two-way state"_ in `conventions.md` records as the shape's cost. `getSelectedValue`
plus `onSelectionChange` keeps the router as owner.

**The floater measures the wrapper, not the control.** `interactionRoot` is `position: relative`, so
wrapping each item reparented the control's `offsetParent` and `offsetTop` / `offsetLeft` reported `0`.
The observer hops one level to `control.offsetParent`, which is exact: the wrapper's box equals the painted
box by construction, and `offset*` is unaffected by `Viewport`'s `transform: scale()`.

**`tooltipDefs` is not on the record yet, for a real hazard rather than YAGNI.** `InteractionWrapper`
branches on prop _presence_, so a record field would be forwarded conditionally and a tab gaining or
losing a tooltip mid-life under `<Index>` reuse would not pick it up. Solid's props getters do make the
conditional reactive, so it can be made to work; it is left out because `Tabs` has no use for it and
untested API is worse than absent API. `Select` will want it.

**A consumer selecting on `:disabled` breaks when a control stops lying about it.** The Playground's
`tabCategory` reset the cursor through `:disabled &` and silently stopped applying; it became
`[aria-disabled='true'] &`. The visible tail of the mechanism decision: consumer stylesheets written
against native disabled do not fail loudly.

**Verified by headless dump**: `role="tablist"`, one `tabindex="0"` across the list with the rest at `-1`,
`aria-selected` on the right item, a floater at a real offset — also the proof that the `offsetParent` hop
resolves and that `ref` forwards through the router's `A`. The disabled-tab half of that proof now lives
on `TabsPage`, since the category item it used no longer exists.

**The list names itself and states its axis.** Added, when `TabsPage` put five tab lists on
one page. `getAriaLabel` lands on the `role="tablist"` element, `RadioGroup`'s arrangement for the same
problem. `aria-orientation="vertical"` is set whenever `dir` is `column`: a tab list is horizontal by
default, so a stacked one that does not say so tells a screen reader user to press the wrong arrows. Not a
general rule about `dir` — it is stated here because `tablist` has a published default a column
contradicts.

**Arrows move the focus and `hasAutoActivation` makes them move the selection too, off by default.** The
published pattern allows both, and calls the second one automatic activation. Manual stays the default
because the cost of guessing wrong is asymmetric: a panel that fetches or builds something expensive is
built once per tab arrowed _past_ under automatic, and the person walking a list to reach the far end pays
for every stop on the way. Automatic is the better behaviour for a panel already in the document, which is
why it is a prop rather than a rejection — and it is one flag rather than a mode string, because there are
exactly two behaviours and no third one is coming.

**The flag rides on the same key handler and changes nothing else.** The arrow already sets the focused
value and moves focus; automatic activation reports that value through `onSelectionChange` afterwards, so
selection still travels the one road, and a consumer who ignores the callback still gets the focus walk.
Nothing new is announced, because the selection change is what a screen reader is already told about.

### `TabPanel`: the pairing is written on the record, and read from both ends

A tab must name the panel it opens and the panel must name the tab back, and the
two elements have different owners — the library owns the tab, the consumer owns the panel — so neither
can complete the link alone.

**Both ids are fields on the record, and neither is generated.** `Tab<T>` gains `id` and `panelId`;
`Tabs` writes them as the tab's `id` and its `aria-controls`, and writes nothing when absent. Radix and
React Aria generate the tab's id privately, which they can only do because their panels are enclosed by
their root. Here a panel may be a page the router mounts elsewhere — the Playground's left menu is that —
so a generated id would have no route to the element that must quote it.

**`TabPanel` is the other end, a wrapper in the `Label` sense**: `getId` and `getTabId` become the panel's
id, `role="tabpanel"` and an `aria-labelledby`. Two strings rather than the record, since two strings are
all it reads. It holds no state and does not decide whether it is mounted. `tabindex="0"` is
unconditional, matching Radix, because a panel of plain prose offers a reader arriving from the tab list
nothing else to land on, and testing for focusable descendants would mean measuring consumer content on
every render.

**It carries no class**, so a consumer's flex or grid child would become this element rather than their own
box. Copy the Playground: `PageTabPanel` holds the `TabPanel` and paints inside it, so the library element
is absorbed by the styled component and layout stays outside both.

**Driven by `tabs.spec.ts` against `TabsPage`, not the Playground's left menu.** The menu is app
furniture — adding a page or renaming a category used to break the keyboard spec and read as a `Tabs`
regression, which happened once. The page carries a row, a column, links, a consumer link component and an
all-disabled list.

### The left menu is one tab list per category

Settled, on the user's call between three options. The menu was a single `role="tablist"`
holding every entry, with `Exotics`, `Fundamentals` and `Composites` inside it as disabled tabs. A tab list
may own tabs and nothing else, and those three were never destinations. They are now `<h2>` elements
outside the lists, and each category gets its own `Tabs` named by `getAriaLabel` with the same text.

**The cost is one tab stop per category rather than one for the menu**, accepted rather than overlooked:
arrows walk within a category and `Tab` crosses between them. The rejected alternative — dropping the
category names from the markup — keeps one stop but tells a screen reader user nothing about a grouping the
sighted user can see.

**The `Tab<T>` `id` / `panelId` pairing is wired here too.** Each component config derives both from its
own name and the routed page is wrapped in `TabPanel`, so the menu stopped being the standing example of a
tab list naming a panel nobody wrote. The `backlog.md` bullet this fixes is about the library, not the
menu: nothing still forces a consumer to do it.

**A category whose entries are all filtered out disappears, heading and all** — an empty heading over an
empty list is furniture with nothing under it. The rule that survived untouched, and the one the `Select`
autocomplete argument rests on: the currently selected entry stays visible even when it does not match.

**`Tabs` stopped orphaning its floater as part of this.** With one list the marker could never be stranded;
with several, the list that used to hold the selection kept drawing its own, because the positioning effect
returned early on "no selected item" instead of acting on it. The first fix cleared the stored bounds and
was superseded a day later by the fader below — the bounds are what the exit animation draws from.

### The floater appears and disappears through `ElementFader`, like every other library element that comes and goes

Settled, at the user's request, once the menu split made a floater that comes and goes
normal. A tab list with no selection has no marker, and that was a hard cut: in the document one frame,
gone the next, with no way for a consumer to fade, shrink or slide it.

**`renderFloater` now takes the same pair every appearing element's painter takes** — a visibility target
of `0` or `1` and the transition duration — which is `Tooltip`, `Popover`, `Modal`, `Toasts` and
`Spotlight`'s signature, transition pair first. `ElementFader.createFader` is driven by "is there a
selected tab whose position we have measured", and the element is mounted while the fader says visible
**or** still transitioning.

**The duration is `getTransitionDurationMs`, the knob the floater already had**, rather than a second one
beside it: a list that slides in 300ms and fades in 80ms describes two animations to one eye. A consumer
who wants them apart puts a CSS `transition` in their painter.

**The stored bounds outlive the selection and die with the element, and both halves are load bearing.**
They are the last place the marker was, which is where the exit is drawn, so clearing them when the
selection goes unmounts the element with nothing to play out. Keeping them past the exit is the other
error and the one that shipped first: a list still holding a position starts its next entrance there, so
the marker returned where it had left and slid across to the new tab over the deliberately long duration.
A second effect watches the fader and clears them once the element is genuinely gone; the positioning
effect re-fills them on a selection change, and the render is gated on having bounds at all, so an entrance
cannot precede a fresh measurement.

The tail of `tabs.spec.ts` measures the rendered box rather than waiting for the entrance to settle — a
slide and an entrance take the same duration, so anything polling until the painter reaches its shown state
has already let the slide finish and passes either way. Checked by putting the fault back and watching the
assertion fail by 106 pixels.

**`TabsPage` grew a variant whose selection can be cleared**, since none of the other five can lose theirs.
It sets a longer duration on purpose: the middle of a 200ms transition is neither watchable by eye nor
readable by a spec without a race.

### `Anchor`: a placement may fall back within its family and never outside it

`getSafeHPlacement` and its vertical twin choose between candidates by asking each where the content would
land — `getHPlacementShift` plus that candidate's own `getHPlacementOffset` — and taking the least
overflow. They used to hand-derive a "space" figure per branch from the anchor's edges, which is how the
`in` branch came to ignore the content size and place content off-screen in 78 of a 240-case sweep.
Deriving the span from the functions that do the positioning makes that class of error unexpressible, and
fixes a second one: the offset was previously computed once from the _requested_ placement and reused to
judge its mirror, whose offset has the opposite sign.

**A placement never crosses between `in` and `out`.** `in` means aligned to an anchor edge and overlapping
it; `out` means beside it. Choosing between them is the consumer stating a relationship, not a hint — a
tooltip that hops from inside its anchor to outside has changed what it means. So `left-in` may become
`right-in` and `left-out` may become `right-out`, and nothing else. `center` may fall back to either `in`,
since a centred layer already overlaps.

The cost is measured: when an anchor is itself clipped by the viewport there are cases where no `in`
placement fits and an `out` one would have. All of them require the anchor to be partly off-screen.

**Content that fits nowhere takes the least-overflow candidate and may run off the screen.** `getPosition`
never clamps. Clamping would keep content visible at the price of detaching it from the edge it was aligned
to, which is the same trade as crossing families and refused for the same reason. A layer wider than the
viewport is the consumer's to size.

### `Anchor`: the positioning half of a floating layer, extracted

Settled, as the other half of the `Select` groundwork. A dropdown needs everything `Tooltip`
knows about placing a box against an element and nothing it knows about when to show one.

**The split is behaviour from markup**, and the existing rule decides where it falls: _"it renders DOM, so
it is not an `Abstract`"_ means the extraction is the effect, not the popup. `Abstracts/Anchor/` holds
`AnchorUtils` (the placement math, formerly `TooltipUtils`, moved unchanged) and
`Anchor.createPortalPosition(getAnchorRef, getIsVisible, opts)`, which observes the anchor, measures the
content, resolves the collision-safe placement and returns `{ getPlacement, getPosition, setContentRef }`.
`Tooltip` lost sixty lines and kept its triggers, `aria-describedby`, `role` and markup.

**The name carries the coordinate space**: `createPortalPosition` returns a position in the `Viewport`
portal's space, which is what a consumer assigns to `top` / `left` on a portalled element. The anchor rect
still comes from `createViewportRectObserver`, so the scale factor is divided out exactly once.

**What stays duplicated is the dozen lines of `<Show><Portal><div>`, deliberately.** Both consumers portal
into the same mount and position absolutely, but disagree about everything else — a tooltip is
`role="tooltip"` and `pointer-events: none`, a listbox is clickable, focusable and `role="listbox"` — so a
shared component would be a two-mode component. Behaviour is shared; markup is not.

`Tooltip` is not renamed. `AnchorPlacement` replaces `TooltipPlacement` (and its `H` / `V` halves) because
the type is now shared vocabulary.

### Controls: `Select`, and who owns a floating list

This and the two `Select` headings after it are what remains of a design brief
deleted once it shipped; `backlog.md` #6 carries what was left out.

**One `mousedown` `preventDefault()` on the popup root is what makes the whole model work.** The options
live in the `Viewport` portal, so clicking one would blur the field. Refusing the default action of
`mousedown` means focus never leaves the field. Three things fall out, and they are why `Tooltip` could not
have been the dropdown: an option click cannot dismiss the popup before the click resolves;
`aria-activedescendant` is honest, because focus really is on the field; and **close-on-blur becomes correct
rather than fatal**, so there is no document-level outside-click listener.

**The field is a `<button role="combobox">`.** The APG select-only pattern uses `<div tabindex="0">`, which
means re-implementing focusability and activation a button has for free, and the house rule is that the leaf
is a real element with real semantics. `Enter` and `Space` are handled in `keydown` with `preventDefault()`,
which suppresses the button's synthesised click — otherwise every keyboard activation toggles twice.

**Options are `role="option"` divs, never buttons, never tab stops.** `getIsTabbable={() => false}` puts
them at `tabIndex -1`; a button inside a listbox breaks option semantics. The consequence a painter must
know: **`isFocused` is never true for an option**, because focus is on the field. Hence their own extras.

**`isHighlighted`, not `isActive`.** `SelectOptionFlags = { isHighlighted, isSelected }`.
`InteractionFlags.isActive` already means "held down" across every control.

**The highlight is a value resolved to an index — never a stored index.** Same shape as `Tabs`' roving
entry: a `highlightedValue` signal and a memo resolving it against the navigable indexes, falling back to
the selected option then the first navigable one. Opening therefore highlights the selection with no
imperative set, and a list changing under a filter cannot leave the highlight pointing elsewhere.

**The painter owns the panel, so the option list arrives as a thunk.**
`renderPopup(renderOptions, getVisibilityTarget, getTransitionDurationMs, getPlacement, getFlags)` — the
consumer returns their own bordered, scrolling, animating box with `{renderOptions()}` inside. The
`renderDecoration` shape (an absolutely-positioned painter behind a library-owned list) was rejected: a
decoration cannot scroll with the content, which would force `max-height` and `overflow` into library props.
`role="listbox"` stays on the library's positioned root and options are descendants at whatever depth the
painter nests them, which ARIA allows as long as nothing between carries a conflicting role.

**Geometry is the library's, including the width floor.** `createPortalPosition` also returns
`getAnchorRect`, and the popup root sets `min-width` from it. A painter cannot compute this — it is portalled
away from the field — and a dropdown narrower than its control is a positioning artefact, not a style choice.
Everything above the floor stays the painter's, exactly as `getMinWidth` draws that line for adornment insets.

**`pointer-events` is switched off for the closing fade**, since `ElementFader` keeps the popup mounted for
the transition and a click during those 200ms would select a second time from a list visually leaving. The
inline style overrides the `pointer-events: all` the class needs while open.

**Single-select first, and no shared private composite yet.** `valueSignal: Signal<T | undefined>` is what a
consumer already holds; `Signal<T[]>` for both cases would tax the common one and make "nothing selected"
representable twice. Multi differs in behaviour, so the `BinarySwitch` shape is the likely end state, but
erecting it before a second consumer would be guessing at the seam.

**The keyboard walk stops on reachable-disabled options and refuses to select them**, matching `RadioGroup`.
`getNavigableIndexes` calls `InteractionTracker.computeIsReachable` with the option's own three fields rather
than re-deriving the rule.

**`scrollIntoView({ block: "nearest" })` on the highlighted option** is the only way the library reaches a
scroll container the painter owns. It runs from an effect on the highlight, so it covers opening onto a
selection far down the list as well as the walk.

### Controls: `Select`'s autocomplete, and why the consumer filters

The question was whether `Select` owns a default matcher with a `computeIsMatch`
escape hatch, or owns only the query string.

**The consumer filters, and the precedent is the Playground's own left menu.** `Tabs` has no filtering API:
`AppContent` owns the search box, the query, and derives each list's tabs. Its rules are the argument — it
decides what a fully-filtered category does, and it **keeps the currently selected item even when it does
not match**. Neither is expressible by a library matcher over an unknown `T`, and the second silently breaks
a select whose matcher would filter the selected option away. The `Select` page makes the point from the
other end: it matches an airport on **either its city or its IATA code**, two fields the library cannot know
exist. Ownership follows knowledge.

**`Select` owns the query, because the query is the field's text.** `querySignal: Signal<string>` is a
`*Signal` by the existing rule, since the component writes it on every keystroke and the consumer reads it
to derive `getOptions`. The loop through the consumer is a plain memo, not a cycle.

**"No matches" stopped being a flag.** The candidate `hasNoMatches` is gone rather than deferred: the consumer filtered, so it already knows the result is empty, and
its empty state is its own JSX inside `renderPopup`. A flag would be the library telling the consumer
something they just computed.

**The mode is `querySignal`'s presence, and this is the one sanctioned use of that.** No `getIsAutoComplete` boolean beside it. _"Presence as a
trigger fails invisibly"_ warns about a prop whose real purpose is something else quietly changing
semantics; a query string has exactly one purpose, an editable field with nowhere to put its text is
incoherent, and forgetting the prop yields a working non-editable select — so it fails toward the safe
default. Precedent: `Tab<T>`'s `href` choosing `<a>` over `<button>`.

**One leaf, two elements, in the `TabsItem` shape.** `SelectField` holds a `commonProps` object of getters
for the shared ARIA and a `<Show>` rendering either a `<button>` or an `<input>`. The `<input>` follows
overlay geometry, and `getPadding` plus `computeTextStyle` are the same two props `TextInput` uses.
`TextInputTextStyle` is imported rather than re-declared: same concept, and duplicating a twelve-key `Pick`
to avoid a sibling import is the worse trade.

**The painter draws the selection, the input draws the query, and `isFiltering` decides which is visible.**
The two texts are stacked by the overlay geometry, so the painter fades its value text out while the query
is non-empty and back in when it clears — so no option ever needs a `label` field for the field to display a
selection.

**The component clears the query, and waits for the fade to finish.** Closing ends the interaction, so the
query is the component's to reset; doing it in `close()` repopulated the consumer's list mid-fade and
visibly re-grew the box. It now runs off `ElementFader`'s `getHasTransitionFinished`, guarded on the query
already being empty so it never writes on mount.

**An editable field takes the keyboard back.** `Space` types a space instead of selecting, and `Home` /
`End` move the caret instead of jumping to the first or last option — both gated on the mode, because
hijacking either in a text field is a bug rather than a shortcut. `Enter`, `Escape`, `Tab` and the arrows
are unchanged. Typing opens the popup and resets the highlight, so each keystroke re-highlights the first
option of the new list.

**While filtering, the highlight prefers the first option over the selection.** Otherwise typing `lis` with
`Oslo` selected leaves the highlight on `Oslo` and `Enter` re-picks it. The limit is inherent to the consumer
owning the filter: the component knows which options are _present_, not which _matched_, so a consumer
injecting a non-matching option can still see the highlight land on it. That is theirs to fix in their own
filter, and it is why the left menu's keep-the-selected-item rule must not be copied into a select.

**`TextSync` came out of `TextInput` because a second consumer arrived.** `Abstracts/TextSync/` holds
`createValueSync(ref, value, opts)` — the element/value sync, the caret restore after a transforming setter,
the IME composition gating. Exactly `TextInput.syncElement`'s code; extracting beat duplicating fifteen
lines of caret arithmetic.

### One walk numbers the options, and both of `Select`'s rendering paths read it

`Select` renders a grouped list two ways — mounted, which walks the written items and nests a `role="group"`
box per group, and windowed, which walks a flat row list because a window cannot draw a box whose ends are
outside it. Both need the same number for each option: **its flat index among all options**, which is what the
highlight, `aria-activedescendant`, typeahead and the keyboard all index by.

**That number used to be worked out twice, once per path**, by two walks that had to agree and nothing checked:
a `getItemOffsets` memo inside `Select.tsx` counting options per written item for the mounted path, and a
running counter inside `SelectUtils.getRows` for the windowed one. Two walks producing one number is the shape
of a bug that only shows on one of the two paths, which is also the harder of the two to look at.

**`getItemOffsets` is now in `SelectUtils` and `getRows` is built on it**, so there is one definition of how
many options precede a written item and the row list reads its `optionIndex` from that. Neither rendering path
changed. `Select.utils.test.ts` pins the walk directly — including that an empty group contributes nothing, so
the offsets repeat rather than leaving a hole — and that the option indexes on the rows are the same sequence
`getFlatOptions` produces, which is the agreement that used to be implicit.

**Note what is not shared: the row index and the option index are different numbers**, and
`getRowIndexOfOption` is the bridge. A group header is a row and is not an option, so the two spaces diverge
the moment a list is grouped. `Tree` has no such split — every row is a node — which is the difference that
makes the two components' flatteners less alike than they look.

### Grouping and windowing compose, and the group box is what makes it possible

**The window runs over rows, not options.** `SelectUtils.getRows` flattens the item list into one row per group
header and one per option, each carrying the option's flat index so the highlight, the ids, typeahead and the
keyboard walk keep counting options the way they always did. `getIsVirtualized` no longer refuses a grouped
list; the only condition left is that the consumer supplied an estimate.

**A `role="group"` box holds whatever slice of its group is in the window, and that is correct rather than a
compromise.** The obstacle recorded against this was that a box wraps its options, so a window opening halfway
down a group would have to draw a box whose header is above the window and whose end is below it. It dissolves
once the box's own entry above is taken seriously: the box is **not paintable** — the library owns
`<div role="group" aria-label>` and the consumer fills only the header. A box with no paint has no visual
extent to preserve, so wrapping only the mounted rows changes nothing a reader can see, and the group's name
travels on `aria-label`, which is present whether or not the header row is in the window.

**Visible rows are cut into runs of one group.** Consecutive rows sharing a group get one box; a run beginning
mid-group is ordinary. The box is a static element, so the rows inside keep resolving their `position:
absolute` against the sizer and their transforms are untouched — wrapping them costs no layout.

**The header is not sticky, and that is not a taste call.** Windowing is an optimisation, so the windowed list
must look like the mounted one, and in the mounted list a header scrolls away with its group. Repeating or
pinning a header would make the two renderings differ by whether the consumer happened to pass an estimate.
If sticky headers are ever wanted they belong to both renderings at once.

**The pinned row keeps its own box.** `getPinnedRows` already held the highlighted option mounted so typeahead
and the active-descendant id survive scrolling; converted to a row index it now also pulls that option's group
box along, which is why a scrolled list can show two boxes — the group under the window and the one holding the
pinned row.

**`computeEstimatedGroupHeight` is optional and falls back to the option estimate.** A header is usually
shorter than an option, and an estimate that is wrong only shifts the scrollbar until the row is measured, so
requiring it would be ceremony; getting it right is worth doing when the headers are tall.

### Controls: option groups, and `Select` / `MultiSelect` as presets

Settled, completing the brief. Both landed together because they answer the same question
from opposite ends: what the option list is a list _of_, and what a selection is.

**A group is a record with children, in the same array as ungrouped options.**
`SelectItem<T> = SelectOption<T> | SelectOptionGroup<T>`, discriminated by `SelectUtils.getIsGroup`
(`"options" in item`), so a list can mix both and a group cannot be malformed — no sibling marker to get out
of order, no second prop to keep in step. `SelectOption<T>` is a closed record shape, so the `in` check
cannot be fooled by a `T` with its own `options` field.

**The tree is a rendering concern only; everything else works off the flat list.**
`SelectUtils.getFlatOptions` gives traversal order, and the keyboard, highlight, ids and selection all index
into it — so the arrow walk crosses group boundaries without knowing groups exist, and `Home` / `End` reach
the ends of the whole list. The one piece of bookkeeping is `getItemOffsets`, mapping each top-level item to
where its options start in the flat list, which lets a nested `<Index>` hand each slot its flat index.

**The library owns `role="group"` and its name; the consumer paints the header.** The wrapper is a bare
`<div role="group" aria-label={label}>` and `renderGroup(getGroup)` fills in the visible header. Two
rejections: `display: contents`, because Chromium has historically dropped such elements from the
accessibility tree and the role is the point of the element; and a `renderGroup(getGroup, renderOptions)`
thunk in `renderPopup`'s shape, which would put the ARIA role in consumer markup. The cost is that a
consumer cannot style the group box itself, only its header — recorded rather than solved, since the thunk
form is available later.

**Option refs are gone, and each option scrolls itself into view.** An array keyed by index cannot survive a
tree, since a flat index shifts when a preceding group is filtered. `SelectOptionItem` watches its own
`isHighlighted` and calls `scrollIntoView({ block: "nearest" })` on its own element, correct at any depth.

**`SelectComposite` is private, `Select` and `MultiSelect` are thin presets over it** — the `BinarySwitch`
shape, down to `SelectPresetProps<T>` being an `Omit` of the composite's props. `index.ts` exports the two
presets and the types but not the composite. The seam is four props: `getSelectedOptions`,
`computeIsSelected`, `onPick`, `getIsMultiple`. Everything else is written once.

**Multi is a preset rather than a mode flag because the value's _type_ changes.**
`Signal<T | undefined>` versus `Signal<T[]>` cannot be reconciled by a boolean, and a single `Signal<T[]>`
would tax the common case and give "nothing selected" two spellings. The composite never sees a value: it
asks the preset which options are selected and tells it what was picked. `MultiSelect` toggles membership;
`Select` replaces. That is why `renderContent` takes `getSelectedOptions` plural and `Select`'s preset
narrows it to `getSelectedOptions()[0]`.

**Picking in a multi list keeps it open, and moves the highlight to what was picked.** The second half was
found by driving it: with the highlight left alone, arrowing after a mouse pick continued from the _first
selected_ option. `aria-multiselectable="true"` goes on the listbox, and `isSelected` on an option stays a
boolean — an option is selected or it is not. The three-way value belongs to the group header, below.

**A group header is told how much of its group is selected, through a second argument rather than a new prop.**
`renderGroup` was `(getGroup) => JSX.Element` and is now `(getGroup, getFlags) => JSX.Element`, where
`SelectGroupFlags` carries one field, `checkedState`. Adding an argument rather than a prop keeps every
existing header working untouched — a consumer who does not want the state simply never names the second
parameter — and it matches `renderOption`, which has taken `(getOption, getFlags)` all along. The field is
a record rather than a bare accessor so that a second thing about a group has somewhere to go.

**The state is computed the same way in both presets, and is degenerate in one of them.** `Select` and
`MultiSelect` differ only in `computeIsSelected`, which the header folds over the group's own options, so a
single-select group holding the selected option reports `"mixed"` — accurate, since some of its options are
selected and some are not, but never useful, because a single-select group can only reach `true` when it
holds exactly one option. Gating the computation on `isMultiple` was rejected: it would make one field mean
two different things depending on which preset was mounted, and the consumer paints the header anyway, so a
single-select consumer simply does not ask for the flags. The Playground does exactly that — only the
grouped multi-select passes them through to `PageSelectGroupContent`.

**A disabled option is still a member of its group.** The Playground's Nordics group holds a disabled Finland,
so picking Denmark and Sweden leaves that header at `"mixed"` for good. Excluding unpickable options was
rejected because it would let a header say _everything here is selected_ while an option sat there unselected,
which is worse than a header that never fills in. The rule is that the header describes the group's options
against the current selection, and nothing else.

**Nothing about this reaches the accessibility tree, and that is not an omission.** A `role="group"` has no
checked state in ARIA — `aria-checked` is not among the attributes it supports — and each option already
announces its own through `aria-selected`. So `checkedState` is paint input and nothing more, and the library
still draws no header of its own.

**`inert` is what disables a closing popup, not `pointer-events`.** A real bug: the fading popup carried
`pointer-events: none` on its root, which looked sufficient and was not — `pointer-events` is inherited, but
every option sets `pointer-events: all` explicitly (it has to, to beat `interactionRoot`'s `none`), and an
explicit value on a descendant beats an inherited one. So a click aimed at whatever sat under a closing
popup was swallowed by an option of a list already visually gone. `inert` disables an entire subtree for
pointer events, focus and the accessibility tree regardless of descendants; `FocusManager.isReachable` already
tests `[inert]`, so support was assumed all along. **General rule: `pointer-events` on an ancestor cannot
switch off a subtree, only `inert` can.**

**Behaviours a `Select` guarantees, to re-check after touching it** — none visible in markup, and the last
two were wrong once: `Enter` on a reachable-disabled option changes nothing and leaves the popup open;
clicking an option leaves `document.activeElement` on the field; a disabled field neither opens nor takes
focus while its reachable twin stays at `tabIndex 0`; the arrow walk skips a disabled option _inside_ a group
and crosses into the next; a multi list stays open across a pick and moves its highlight to the row picked;
and a closing popup lets a click through.

### Controls: `Popover` extracted, and `Menu` as the second consumer

The standing "private until a second consumer" rule fired: `Select`'s floating layer
became `Fundamentals/Popover/`.

**This does not reverse _"What stays duplicated is the dozen lines of `<Show><Portal><div>`"_ — it is the
same argument reaching the opposite answer on different inputs.** That entry refused to share markup between
a tooltip and a listbox because they agree on nothing. A listbox and a menu are both _interactive_ floating
layers and agree on every line. `Tooltip` keeps its own dozen lines and stays out.

**`Popover` owns everything true of a floating layer and nothing about what it contains:** the portal mount,
`createPortalPosition`, the `ElementFader`, `inert` while the fade closes, the `mousedown` refusal,
`tabindex="-1"`, and the anchor-width floor. Content arrives as
`renderContent(getVisibilityTarget, getTransitionDurationMs, getPlacement)` — `Tooltip`'s signature.

**The role is the consumer's, so the ARIA that role requires is the consumer's too.** `getRole` plus one
`getAriaAttributes: Accessor<JSX.AriaAttributes>` rather than a prop per role-specific attribute.
`aria-multiselectable` is a listbox word and `aria-labelledby`-to-the-trigger is a menu word; a `Popover`
learning either would grow a branch per consumer. It sits on the same element as the role because it has to
— the options are descendants, so the role cannot be nested one level in.

**The anchor-width floor is opt-in, because the argument for it was a listbox argument.** A menu hanging off
an icon button has no such relationship and should size to its content. `Select` passes
`getHasAnchorMinWidth`, `Menu` does not.

**The fader stays inside and reports out through `onTransitionStatusChange`**, the shape `Modal` uses. A
component cannot return values, and `Select` needs the settled flag to know when it may clear the query.

**`outline: none` on the root is deliberate and is not a colour decision.** The root is focusable only to
host `aria-activedescendant`; the visible focus is the highlighted item, painted by the consumer. A ring
around the whole surface would point at the wrong thing.

**It is written twice so a consumer cannot reverse it by accident**, added later. A bare `outline`
on the class ties with a consumer's blanket `:focus-visible` rule on specificity, so the winner is whichever
stylesheet was emitted last — the Playground's was, which is how every popup grew a ring nobody asked for.
The rule is repeated under `&:focus, &:focus-visible`, which outranks a plain pseudo-class rather than racing
it. What it gives up: a `Select` whose filter emptied the list has nothing painted as focused and is
announced empty; a consumer wanting a ring there paints it on their own surface.

**The initial focus is `Popover`'s, and a real bug is why.** `Menu` first called `FocusManager.autoFocus`
itself and focus stayed on the trigger: the root carries `visibility: hidden` until `Anchor` has produced a
position, and a `visibility: hidden` element silently refuses `focus()`. Being positioned is `Popover`'s own
state, so `getHasAutoFocus` moved the call inside, gated on `getPosition() !== undefined`. **The gate is a
memo of the boolean, not of the position**: the position object is rebuilt on every anchor observation, so
depending on it directly would re-focus the surface on every scroll.

**`Menu` moves focus to the menu, not to the items, and that is where `aria-activedescendant` is allowed to
live.** ARIA supports the attribute on composite roles — `menu` is one, `button` is not — so the APG variant
with a single focus target puts both on the `role="menu"` element. The items are then `Select`'s options
exactly: non-focusable `role="menuitem"` divs at `getIsTabbable={() => false}`, `isFocused` never true, and
a highlight held as a value resolved to an index. `FocusManager.autoFocus` restores focus to the trigger on
close through the same `onCleanup` `Modal` relies on.

**Two keydown handlers rather than `Select`'s one**, because the two states have different focus owners: the
trigger handles the closed menu (`Enter` / `Space` / `ArrowDown` open on the first item, `ArrowUp` on the
last), the menu handles the open one. They cannot both be focused, so neither tests whether the menu is open.

**Clicking the trigger while the menu is open would otherwise reopen it.** The `mousedown` moves focus to
the trigger, the menu blurs, blur closes, and the click's own toggle then opens it again. The guard is
`relatedTarget === trigger` in the blur handler: focus going to the trigger is not a dismissal, and the
click that follows does the closing. Every other blur still closes with no document-level listener.

**`MenuFlags` is `{ isOpen }` and nothing else.** A menu carries no value, so no `isEmpty`, no
`aria-selected`, no `isSelected` equivalent, and the callback is `onActivate` rather than `onPick`.

**Dismissal was not extracted as an `Abstract`, against the plan that scheduled this work.** `Menu`'s
dismissal turned out to be `Select`'s exactly — `Escape` in a keydown, close on the focused element's blur,
no document listener — while `Modal`'s is a different mechanism (document keydown, overlay click, focus trap,
explicit restore). Two identical siblings and one that does not fit is not the shape that wants an
`Abstract`; the thing genuinely shared with `Modal` was `FocusManager.autoFocus`, which existed.

### `Menu` submenus: a level per popup, focus moving between them

An item may carry `items`, and a level is drawn per popup all the way down.

**The choice was one focus target for the whole tree versus one per level, and support decided it rather
than structure.** Keeping focus on the root menu looked like the smaller change. It is not:
`aria-activedescendant` may only name a descendant of the focused element **or** one claimed through
`aria-owns`, and every level is portalled out to the viewport — so that variant rests entirely on
`aria-owns` across a portal, which is sanctioned and thinly supported. A level holding its own focus has its
items physically inside it, and it is the variant the APG menu examples implement: `ArrowRight` opens a
submenu onto its first item, `ArrowLeft` closes it and returns.

**`MenuLevel` is the recursion; `Menu` is the trigger plus the root level.** A level owns its highlighted
value, which of its items is open, its own popup and its own keyboard. It renders each submenu inside the
item that owns it, so a level unmounts with its parent for free and the anchor is that item's element.

**An item with children is the trigger for its level, and says so in the same words the button does** —
`aria-haspopup="menu"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls` while open. `MenuItemFlags` gained `hasSubmenu` and
`isOpen` so a painter can draw the arrow and the open state, which it could not otherwise infer.

**`MenuItemFlags` is a superset of `MenuFlags`, and that keeps `renderPopup` at one signature.** A popup is
handed the flags of whatever opened it — the trigger's for the root, the parent item's for a submenu.
Disjoint flag types would have forced a union every consumer had to narrow.

**A key is handled by the level it was pressed in, and the check has to be explicit because Solid
re-dispatches delegated events through the component tree rather than the DOM tree.** The levels are
portalled siblings, so nothing bubbles between them in the page — but `keydown` is delegated, and Solid walks
a portal back to the component that rendered it, so a key pressed three levels deep ran every ancestor
level's handler: `Escape` collapsed two levels and `ArrowLeft` closed the menu outright. Each level now
ignores a keydown whose target is not its own popup root. Stopping propagation would have worked and was
rejected: it would swallow the key for anything outside the menu that listens.

**A blur dismisses only when focus has left the whole tree**, identified by id prefix — every level's id
derives from the root's. The previous `relatedTarget === trigger` guard cannot generalise, because closing a
level restores focus to the level above and that restore reaches the parent as a blur; with three levels
open, hovering back up the chain closed everything. The trigger check stays beside it for its own reason.

**Hovering an item opens its submenu, and moves the highlight there.** Splitting them is worse: the highlight
is what `aria-activedescendant` names, so a submenu open under an unhighlighted item states two positions at
once, and `ArrowLeft` back out would land on neither. Hovering an item with no children closes whatever was
open at that level. Nothing is on a timer.

**`ArrowUp` on a closed trigger still opens onto the last item, but the mechanism moved.** The highlight now
lives in the level, so the trigger states an intent — `initialHighlightPosition` — which the level reads only
as the fallback for a highlight nothing has set. It is not written into the level's state, so the first arrow
press walks from it and overwrites it as before.

**A trigger swallows its own keys while its menu is open, rather than opening it again.** Added
. A menu is drawn and highlighted before it takes keyboard focus — the layer takes focus only
once positioned, and its position waits on a `ResizeObserver` callback in a later task. In that window an
`Enter` meant for the highlighted item reached the trigger, which read it the only way it knows: open the
menu. Opening an open menu reset the highlight to the first item, so the keystroke silently moved the
highlight and the next `Enter` ran the wrong item. Refusing the four opening keys while the state says open
turns that into a keystroke ignored, the tolerable failure.

**The default is prevented before the open state is consulted, and the order is load-bearing.** All four
keys activate a `<button>` natively, so returning early without preventing the default lets the browser
synthesise a click that toggles the menu shut.

**What this does not do is make that early keystroke work.** Closing the window means giving a layer focus
as soon as it is open rather than once positioned; the cheap version — reading the content size once on mount
instead of waiting for the observer — was tried and reverted. Positioned a frame earlier, the
menu lands under the pointer that just clicked the trigger and `onMouseEnter` takes the highlight, so six
menu specs failed on a highlight one item further down. That makes it a question about whether the pointer or
the keyboard owns the highlight at open, which nobody has decided.

**The submenu's placement defaults to `right-out` / `top-in`; its offset is zero and belongs to the
consumer.** A submenu anchors to its parent item, and an item sits inside whatever padding and border the
painter's surface has, so a submenu flush against its anchor overlaps the surface it came from. The library
cannot know that inset, so `getSubmenuOffset` is where the consumer states it; the Playground passes its own
surface's padding plus border. Anything a consumer paints _outside_ its box — a drop shadow — overlaps by the
same arithmetic and is theirs by the same argument.

### Typeahead: the text is read off the item, and `computeCustomText` is the way out

Settled on the user's call, closing the gap `Select`, `Menu` and `Tree` each recorded separately. All three
had the same blocker written down — the library has no text for an item, only what the painter drew — and
all three now have typeahead.

**The blocker was smaller than it read, because the item element is the library's own.** A
`role="option"`, a `role="menuitem"` and a `role="treeitem"` are all built here, with the painter's markup
inside them, so the text is already in the document and reachable without asking the consumer for it a
second time. Two of the three libraries checked do exactly this — Radix falls back to the item's rendered
text when no `textValue` is given, and React Aria requires `textValue` only when the children are not plain
text. What the earlier note called "a second source for text the painter already renders" was a prop that
did not have to exist.

**It is the accessible text, not `textContent`, and the difference is not cosmetic.** Every painter here
marks its decorative glyphs `aria-hidden` — `Tree` draws a "▶" before a branch's name, `Select` a "✓" after
a selected option. Raw text would make every branch in the tree begin with an arrow and match nothing a
person would type. So `TypeaheadUtils.getElementText` walks the element and skips any subtree carrying
`aria-hidden`, which lands on the same string a screen reader announces. Typing what you hear is the rule,
and it falls out rather than having to be arranged.

**The override is `computeCustomText`, and the word "custom" is doing work.** Named by the user, so that
the prop's own name says a default already exists — a bare `computeText` would read as the only source and
invite every consumer to supply one. Two cases need it, and only two. A **windowed** list mounts the rows in
view and nothing else, so an unmounted option has no element and no text; the Playground's virtualized
example passes `computeCustomText` for exactly that reason, and typing a route's name reaches one far below
the window. And an item whose paint is **not text** — a swatch, an avatar — has nothing to read.

**The buffer is a factory and the matching is a pure function, which splits the opposite way to the walk.**
`NavigatorUtils.computeNextPosition` was deliberately not a factory because each control owns its cursor
differently. The typeahead buffer is the reverse: a string and a timer, owned identically by all three, with
nothing per-control about it. So `Typeahead.createBuffer` owns that state and
`TypeaheadUtils.computeNextIndex` stays pure, taking positions and a text lookup and returning a position.
The rule from the walk still holds — the abstract answers _which item is next_, the control answers _what to
do about it_: `Select` moves its highlight, `Menu` moves its highlight, `Tree` moves real focus.

**A repeated letter cycles, and a growing query holds.** `l` then `l` means "the next thing starting with
l"; `l` then `i` means Lisbon. One rule covers both: when the query normalises to a single character the
current item is excluded from the scan, otherwise it is not — which is why typing `li` does not walk away
from the Lisbon it just landed on.

**The query is forgotten after a second**, following React Aria and Radix rather than the shorter half-second
some native controls use. A slow typist breaks a two-word name at 500ms, and the cost of the longer window is
only a stale query, which the next pause clears anyway.

**Space joins the query only when there is a query to join.** Space activates a menu item and selects an
option, so it cannot be a query key from cold; once something has been typed it belongs to the query, which
is what makes "depot p" reachable. The dangerous half is the one worth stating: a space typed mid-query must
not run the item the highlight happens to be sitting on, and `menu.spec.ts` pins that.

**Each control claims its own printable keys first.** `Tree` uses `*` to open every branch at a level, which
the published pattern names, so that branch moved above the typeahead check rather than the key being
special-cased inside the abstract. **An autocomplete `Select` is excluded outright** — a field with a query
signal is a real text input and every keystroke belongs to the consumer's filter. Filtering shortens the
list; typeahead walks it; a control does not do both.

**Typing on a closed `Select` opens it and lands on the first keystroke.** The list is opened before the
match runs, and Solid mounts it synchronously on the signal write, so the options exist by the time the text
is read. This was expected to need two keystrokes and does not.

### `ElementFader`: the frame that starts a transition needs a fallback

`setTarget` flips `transitionTarget` inside a `requestAnimationFrame` so the browser
paints the pre-transition state first — without that the CSS transition has no start value. The bug was that
the frame was the _only_ path: `setHasTransitionFinished(false)` happens immediately,
`getIsVisible` is `transitionTarget === 1 || !hasTransitionFinished`, and the duration timer was armed only
inside the callback. So on a page that stops producing frames — a backgrounded tab — a dismissed `Modal`
never leaves: `getIsVisible` stays true, the `<Show>` stays mounted, and the focus trap stays with it.

It now schedules the same idempotent `commit` from both a frame and a 100ms timer, whichever arrives first,
cancelling the loser. The frame wins wherever frames exist; where they do not, the state machine advances
without an animation, which is correct on a page that is not painting.

### Controls: `Progress`, and what a non-interactive Fundamental looks like

The first `Fundamentals` component that is neither an interaction nor a composition
of one, so it settles the shape by being it.

**No `InteractionWrapper`, and no flags.** Nothing to hover, focus or activate. The root is a bare
`<div role="progressbar">` and the painter receives `getState`, not `getFlags` — `ProgressState` is the
analogue, and calling it flags would claim an interaction contract this component does not have.

**The painter is handed a normalised `ratio` as well as the raw value.** Clamping `(value - min) / span`
into 0..1 is the one computation a painter must not repeat, since getting it wrong draws past the end of the
track. `value`, `min` and `max` come along because a painter rendering "1.2 of 2.4 MB" cannot get them
anywhere else — the opposite of `TextInput`, which withholds the value because the input already draws it.
One rule both times: hand over what the painter would otherwise have to double.

**`ratio` is `number | undefined`, and the `undefined` is the mode.** An absent `getValue()` means
indeterminate, which is what ARIA means too — `aria-valuenow` is omitted. Sanctioned "presence as a
trigger": one meaning, and forgetting the prop yields a working indeterminate bar. It reads the **value**,
not the prop, for `getTooltipDefs`' reason — an upload with no total yet returns `undefined` from a
`getValue` that later returns numbers. Extras elsewhere are required so a painter never handles an
`undefined` its control cannot emit; here the control genuinely can emit one.

**The indeterminate animation is the painter's**, contradicting the note that raised this component: an
indeterminate bar is a looping animation with no state behind it, CSS runs it on the compositor free, and a
library-owned clock would burn frames handing over a phase `@keyframes` already gives. The library says
_that_ the bar is indeterminate.

**Placement is the library's**, contradicting the same note in the other direction — see the `Modal` presets.

**`getSizing` defaults to `"fill"`, the inverse of `InteractionWrapper`'s, and the type is declared here
rather than imported.** A control's natural size is its content; a track's is its container. Both
vocabularies have the same two members, and sharing the type would file a non-interactive component's
geometry under `InteractionWrapper.types`.

### Controls: `Drawer` as a `Modal` preset, and why `AlertDialog` is not one

Settled for `Drawer`, the `Toggle`-over-`Checkbox` shape. `AlertDialog` shipped the same day
on the same reasoning and was **deleted **.

**Placement is geometry, not paint** — a correction to the note that asked for these. The slide is paint (a
painter transitions its own `transform` off `getVisibilityTarget`). Placement is not: the box carrying
`role="dialog"` is `Modal`'s, and only its position within `modalRoot` decides where the dialog is. Making it
paint would mean stretching the container over the viewport and letting the painter position itself inside,
which hands the dialog role a viewport-sized box and breaks the margin-derived `max-width` / `max-height`.

**`modalRoot` became a grid so both axes can say `stretch`.** A flex row has no main-axis equivalent of
`justify-items: stretch`, so a top-edge drawer could stick to the top or fill the width but not both.
`modalContainer` is `display: flex; flex-direction: column` with `flex-grow: 1` on its child so the painter
fills whichever axis the grid stretched. The absolutely positioned overlay is unaffected.

**That grid states its single track as `100%`, and without it a dialog taller than the screen escaped the
screen.** An implicit grid track is auto-sized, so a container holding more than fits grew the track with it;
the container's own `max-height: calc(100% - margins)` then resolved against that grown track and capped
nothing, and the dialog ran off the bottom with the overflow unreachable — no scrollbar, because nothing had
been asked to scroll. Stating `grid-template-rows: 100%` and `grid-template-columns: 100%` pins the area to
the root, the `max-height` and `max-width` become real limits again, and a painter with `overflow: auto`
scrolls inside them. Found when every drawer on the Playground page was given more content than fits.

**`ModalAlignment`, not `ModalPlacement`** — `AnchorPlacement` already names `{ x, y }` collision placement,
and one prop meaning a string union on one component and a record on another is the two-contracts-one-name
trap.

**`Drawer` narrows to four edges and adds nothing else**: `DrawerEdge` drops `"center"`, and `getEdge` is
required where `getAlignment` was optional. An edge-attached dialog that could be centred is not a drawer.

**`AlertDialog` was a preset that earned nothing.** It set `role="alertdialog"`, required
`getInitialFocusRef` and turned overlay-click dismissal off — three props already public on `Modal`, and no
behaviour of its own. The line: `Drawer` narrows a vocabulary so a wrong state is unexpressible;
`AlertDialog` only pre-filled values. A component whose whole body is three defaults is a comment with a
build step. This does not overturn the `Toggle`-over-`Checkbox` rule — `Toggle` both removes surface and adds
semantics a consumer cannot reach (the `switch` role, the mixed-state role swap).

Its reasoning now belongs to whoever sets those three props: an alert interrupts to demand a decision, so
focus must land on the control that answers it and the initial focus target is not optional; and a dialog
demanding an answer must not be answerable by clicking next to it. `Escape` still closes it, because every
dialog must be escapable regardless of role. `ModalPage` carries it as a second variant, which is the honest
demonstration — it shows the three props rather than hiding them.

**`FocusManager.autoFocus` reads the initial ref untracked, and "initial" is why.** The effect already depends
on the container ref and visibility; a third dependency that can change while the dialog is open would
re-run it, re-capture `previouslyFocused` as whatever is focused _now_, and restore focus to the wrong
element on close. A ref assigned during render is set before effects run, so the common path is unaffected.

**`getIsDismissableOnOverlayClick` and `getAriaDescribedBy` are public on `Modal`** — a form with unsaved
changes wants the first, any dialog can want the second.

### Controls: `FileInput` and `ColorInput`, where the UA owns the activation

Both are the `TextInput` arrangement (overlay geometry, wrapper, flags, private
leaf), and both exist because of one thing the library cannot take over.

**Activation must stay native, so gating a disabled control is `preventDefault` on `click`.** Only a user
gesture on the real element opens a file dialog or the OS colour picker, so there is no JS path to gate and
no `readonly` to lean on. `preventDefault` cancels the default action — `BinarySwitch`'s mechanism rather
than `Button`'s early return, which would have left both dialogs opening. `wrapElement`'s `mousedown`
refusal still keeps a disabled control from taking focus.

**Suppressing the UA's own rendering is the rule that kept `placeholder` and the number spinner out**, and
each needed a different mechanism:

- **A file input** hides `::file-selector-button` and sets `color: transparent` for the filename. It stays
  transparent-but-present rather than `opacity: 0`, because opacity paints the outline too.
- **A colour input** needs `visibility: hidden` on `::-webkit-color-swatch`; a transparent background is
  **not** enough, since the UA paints the current colour onto the swatch through a path an author
  `background` does not reach, covering the painter with a solid rectangle. Visible on screen and invisible
  to every DOM assertion — the shape of what markup checks cannot catch. `visibility` takes the swatch out
  of paint and leaves the input's outline alone.

**Both give the painter the value, and `TextInput` deliberately does not.** `FileInputFlags = { files }`,
`ColorInputFlags = { value }`: once the native rendering is suppressed nothing else draws them. The other
side of one rule — withhold what the element already draws, hand over what it does not.

**`syncElement` returns for a third time**, on `BinarySwitch`'s premise:

- **`ColorInput`** assigns `value` when it differs, so a snapping owner ("nearest of four") sees its
  correction reach the element instead of the picker's raw colour.
- **`FileInput`** cannot be pushed into an arbitrary state, because a `FileList` cannot be constructed. Only
  the empty case is expressible, via `element.value = ""`, and it is the case that matters: an owner that
  rejects a file and writes `[]` back would otherwise leave the input holding it, and **re-picking the same
  file fires no `change` event**, so the user cannot retry what they were just told to fix.

**Scoped without drag-and-drop, deliberately.** A drop target belongs to whatever surface accepts the drop,
and adding it would give `FileInput` a second activation path.

### Controls: `Stepper`, where the state vocabulary is the consumer's

Built, after the longest design conversation in this file's history. A progress strip over a
multi-step flow.

**The library never computes whether a step is complete.** Each step arrives with a `state` the component
declares as a generic and never inspects — `done`, `failed`, `skipped`, whatever the consumer needs — and
its source is deliberately unknown. This dissolved the months-old "what does the stepper gate on" question:
nothing, because it is told.

**What the library does own is `aria-current="step"`**, which is not a state a consumer may invent.
`aria-current` is enumerated and `step` means exactly this, and an unrecognised value degrades silently to
plain `true` — so a consumer expressing "current" as one of their own states would produce a strip whose
position is invisible to a screen reader. Same split `Breadcrumbs` makes with `aria-current="page"`.

**`computeStepAriaLabel` is required, and that is why the free vocabulary is safe.** No ARIA attribute
exists for "this step failed", for any invented state, so a red ring on step two is indistinguishable from
step three and the only route by which an invented state can be announced is **text in the accessible
name**. The strings are the consumer's, for the reason `TagInput` does not ship the word "Remove".

**Navigability is per step and decides the element, not an attribute.** A step you can move to is a
`<button>`; one you cannot is a `<span>` — `Breadcrumbs`' call for its last crumb. A non-navigable step with
a tooltip stays reachable, which is `getIsReachableWhenDisabled`'s pairing, derived from whether a tooltip
exists rather than taken as a prop, so that rule's warning can never fire from here.

**Each step is its own tab stop; there is no roving order.** Researched on request. Roving is legal — no
criterion counts tab stops — but the APG's account of how a user _discovers_ arrow keys is that assistive
technology recognises the role and says so, and its composite list (combobox, grid, listbox, menu, radio
group, tabs, toolbar, treegrid, tree view) has no stepper. An ordered list of buttons announces "list", so
roving hides most of the strip from anyone who did not guess. No ARIA attribute advertises arrow-key
navigation either: `aria-keyshortcuts` is for shortcuts that activate or focus, `aria-roledescription`
renames a role without adding behaviour and is explicitly discouraged, and `role="application"` disables
browse mode wholesale. Getting the announcement would mean claiming `role="tablist"`, which asserts the
steps swap panels — untrue when the state source is agnostic. A stepper that does swap panels is `Tabs`.

The sharper argument is local: a locked or failed step stays reachable **so its tooltip can be read**, and
under roving someone who does not know to press an arrow tabs in, lands on the current step, tabs out, and
never reaches it.

**Both orientations ship**, as a `dir` prop with `aria-orientation` on the list.

**Not built:** the connector is a slot rather than something the library draws, and nothing enforces that a
linear flow is linear — a consumer who marks every step navigable gets free navigation, which is
`nonLinear` elsewhere and needs no prop here.

**The entry takes the list's direction, and the first build forgot to give it one.** Fixed afterwards.
`dir` was written onto the `<ol>` alone, but the `<li>` holds the step and the connector after it and was a
hard-coded row — so a column strip laid a 2px hairline to the right of the label instead of a track running
down the page. The `<li>` now carries the same `flex-direction`. Nothing else was wrong with the column
case, which is why it looked like a paint bug.

**A row strip wraps rather than overflowing.** Four steps with word-length names are
wider than a 370px column, and the strip had no answer: `stepperList` could not shrink (the painter's labels
are `nowrap`, the connector is a fixed-size slot the library does not own) and could not wrap, so it grew
past its container **in both directions** — the first entry sat at `offsetLeft: -45`. Of shrinking,
scrolling and wrapping: shrinking is not the library's to do, since it needs the painter to let its labels
truncate; scrolling hides steps behind a gesture with nothing saying they are there; wrapping needs nothing
from the painter and truncates no label. A consumer wanting either of the others has `overflow` on their own
container. The `<li>` is the wrap unit, so a connector never separates from its step — a wrapped line can
end on a connector, which is the cost. `maxWidth: 100%` on the list and `minWidth: 0` on the entry stop a
single over-wide step escaping either edge.

### Controls: `SplitPane`, where CSS grid is the arithmetic

Resizable panes with a draggable gutter between each pair.

**The stated objection to building it was wrong**: `backlog.md` held that this would be the first control to
write a dimension, against a rule that the library leaves layout to the consumer. `Collapsible` already
writes a measured pixel height, the `Tabs` and `RadioGroup` floaters write a full box, `Viewport` scales its
contents, and the library already owns wrapper elements around consumer content (`Breadcrumbs`' `<li>`,
`Select`'s group box). The rule the objection appealed to does not exist in that form.

**The value is ratios, and pixels are never stored.** `ratiosSignal` is `Signal<number[]>`, one share per
pane. A container resize must not rewrite what the person chose: drag to 30/70 in a 1000px box, narrow the
window, and the stored `0.3` stands while the rendered widths clamp. Same shape as `ColorArea` keeping HSV
while emitting hex, and `DateValue` keeping the lossless form.

**The layout is one `grid-template` string and nothing else.** A pane is
`calc(ratio * (100% - totalGutterPx))`, and a pane with bounds is that share inside a `clamp()`; gutters are
fixed tracks between them. A window resize needs no observer and no code — the browser recomputes. That is
why this shape beat an `fr`-based one: `fr` cannot appear inside `clamp()` or `min()`, so a per-pane maximum
is not expressible alongside it, while percentages and pixels compose freely. N panes come free.

**When the minimums cannot all fit, it overflows — accepted by the user.** Two floors of 250px
and 400px in a 600px box do not shrink proportionally; grid honours both and the row spills. Chosen over
computing a proportional shrink, which needs a `ResizeObserver` and the library rewriting floors on every
resize. The user's reasoning: grid's behaviour is consistent, expected and documented, a consumer declaring
floors that cannot fit is misusing the API, and inheriting the platform's answer beats inventing a second
one. `splitPane.spec.ts` pins it.

**A gutter moves its two neighbours and nothing else.** Their combined share is conserved, so ratios keep
summing to one without a normalisation pass and dragging at one end never reflows the far side.

**The gutter is a `<button>` with `role="separator"`, and it carries a value.** `aria-valuenow` is the
boundary as a percentage over 0–100, `aria-orientation` states the axis, and the arrow keys for that axis
move it by `keyStep`. A drag-only splitter is unreachable without a pointer.

**The drag is local rather than `InteractionTracker.trackDrag`.** That helper measures the pointer against the
element it is attached to, right when the drag surface _is_ the measured surface (`Range`, `ColorArea`). Here
the drag surface is the gutter and the measured surface is the container. If a third consumer of that shape
appears, widening `trackDrag` to take a separate measuring ref is the change to argue then.

**A pixel bound has to be reconciled with a ratio value, and CSS alone cannot do it.** Fixed,
correcting the above. `minPx` / `maxPx` were only the `clamp()` around each track — correct for _rendering_,
useless for _dragging_: `moveBoundary` knew nothing about them, so a drag kept writing ratios the `clamp()`
refused. Past a pane's floor the pane stopped while the gutter carried on under the pointer, the far pane
went on growing, and the tracks summed to more than the container. The bound is now converted to a ratio
against the container's measured size and the drag clamped there.

Two non-obvious details. **The measurement is `offsetWidth` / `offsetHeight`, not `getBoundingClientRect`** —
`Viewport` scales its contents, so a client rect is layout size times a factor that is almost never 1, while
`minPx` is a layout-space number. `computePointerBoundary` keeps the client rect, correctly, because both
sides of its division carry the same factor. **And the CSS `clamp()` stays**: the drag clamp holds while the
pointer moves, the `clamp()` holds when the _container_ resizes. When floors cannot all fit, the drag clamp's
window is empty and it pins to the floor, which is what `clamp(min, …, max)` does when `min > max` — so the
accepted overflow survives.

**Not built:** collapsing a pane to nothing and restoring it, a double-click to reset, persisting the split.
All three are the consumer's, since they own the signal.

### Controls: `TagInput`, and why it is not a `TextField` preset

A field whose value is a list: type a word, press Enter, it becomes a tag beside the
caret.

**It owns its own box rather than sitting in `TextField`'s leading slot, and that was the whole decision.**
The cheap route was a preset like `NumberInput` with tags in `renderLeading`. That slot is absolutely
positioned and the input's left padding inset by its measured width — right for a currency symbol, wrong for
a list: the moment tags wrap onto a second row, an out-of-flow strip and one inset number cannot describe the
layout. Widening `TextField` to make its slot optionally in-flow was the third option, rejected on ownership:
`TextField` is a single-line field with decorations at its edges, and a tag input is a box of controls that
happens to contain a field. Bending the first into the second costs four shipped presets a concept they do
not need.

**Twelve tags in a 240px box wrap, and the box grows — settled by the user.** Nothing clips,
nothing scrolls sideways, no cap. Stated rather than hidden: the control's height is a function of its value,
so a form reflows as tags are added. That is what every published tag input does, and the alternatives were
deferred rather than missed — a `maxRows`-style cap, a single scrolling line over `Scroller`, and a "+10
more" collapse are all additions on top of wrapping. `tagInput.spec.ts` pins the growth.

**Backspace on an empty field steps into the tags rather than deleting one.** First press moves focus onto
the last tag, a second removes it. Deleting outright changes the value with nothing focused to announce it,
which is silent for a screen reader and invisible to anyone who mis-hit the key. `ArrowLeft` does the same
step, arrows walk the tags, walking past the last returns to the field. Backspace only leaves the field when
the field is empty, or it would swallow ordinary editing.

**The tag is a `<button>` whose accessible name is the tag text, and pressing it removes it.** No separate
delete trigger; a consumer painting an `✕` is painting decoration on a control that is already the remove
control. The name defaults to the tag's own text rather than "Remove X", because a library that paints
nothing has no business shipping an English sentence — `computeTagAriaLabel` is where a consumer supplies
wording.

**Tags are `string[]`, not `T[]`.** Every other list control here is generic; a tag genuinely is the text
that was typed, with no identity apart from its characters. A consumer needing records keeps a map beside it.
`computeTag` is where text becomes the stored form — trimming, casing, refusing a duplicate — and returning
nothing declines a word, leaving the text in the field to be edited rather than retyped.

**The draft text is private unless asked for**: `textSignal` is optional through
`SignalMirror.createOptional`, the arrangement the popups use for their open state.

**Owning the box means owning the pointer back, which the first build did not.** Fixed afterwards.
`interactionRoot` sets `pointer-events: none` and each part turns it back on for itself (`buttonElement` does,
`textFieldElement` does); `tagInputField` did
not, so the field could not be clicked, focused or typed into and the control read as a box of tags with no
text entry. Every spec passed throughout, because `fill()` writes the element directly and never asks whether
a person could have reached it — the click path is now asserted, and that is the general lesson. The root
turns pointer events on too, with `cursor: text` and a `pointerdown` that focuses the field when the press
landed on the root itself, so the padding around the tags behaves like the padding of any text box.

**A control that owns its box must be positioned, or the painter paints over it.** Fixed, and
the more general of the two. `renderContent` draws an opaque box at `position: absolute; inset: 0`, and CSS
paints positioned elements _after_ ordinary in-flow content regardless of document order — so the painter's
background covered the field's text. The value was in the DOM, the caret was in the field, the click worked,
and the box looked empty. The tags escaped only by accident, each sitting in an `InteractionWrapper` whose
root is `position: relative`; `TextField` escapes it deliberately, its element being absolute too.

So: **anything the painter is meant to sit behind has to be positioned.** `tagInputRoot` is now
`position: relative`. This is the trap for every future control rendering in-flow content next to
`renderContent` — the symptom is content that is simply not there, and nothing in the markup or the flags
hints at it.

**The field is a row of its own beneath the tags.** Settled by the user, and recorded
because the first build arrived there by accident and the second "fixed" it. An `<input>`'s intrinsic width
is around 177px (the default `size`), and `flex-basis: auto` takes that as its starting size, so it happened
not to fit beside the tags and wrapped. That looked like a stray empty row and was changed to a 60px basis.
The user asked for the full row and is right about the shape: chips in front of a caret read as a search box
that has already matched something, while a block of tags with an empty line under it reads as a list and a
place to add to it. It is now `flex: 1 0 100%` — a 100% basis cannot share a line, so the break is declared
rather than incidental.

**The caret is the painter's, through `computeTextStyle`.** `TagInput` had no way to reach the
input's text, so the caret fell back to the inherited colour while every other field drew the theme's. The
slot is `TextField`'s, reused with the same name and `TextFieldTextStyle` type — the `TabLinkProps`
precedent: a second identical type for the second caller is the thing to avoid.

**A printable key on a focused tag returns to the field.** `handleTagKeyDown` answered
only Backspace, Delete and the arrows, so a letter pressed on a tag went nowhere. Focus now moves back to the
field and the keystroke lands there. Deliberately not `preventDefault`ed: the character is inserted by the
default action, after the handler has moved focus.

**Disabled has to close the write paths, not only announce itself.** Same fix. The field carried
`aria-disabled` and nothing else, so a disabled tag input could still be typed into and Enter still added
tags. It now takes `readOnly` the way `TextField` does — never native `disabled` — and both key handlers
return early. `userSelect: text` was missing for the same reason as `pointer-events`.

**Not built:** a cap or a collapse; editing a tag in place; pasting a delimited list as several tags; a drag
to reorder.

### Controls: `Breadcrumbs`, and why the last crumb is not a control

A trail of links to where you are. The standing position was that it was a `Tabs`
composition; what earns it a file is markup the consumer cannot get from `Tabs` at all.

**A trail is a landmark around an ordered list**: `<nav aria-label>` holding an `<ol>` holding one `<li>` per
crumb. The landmark lets someone jump straight to the trail; the list makes "four of these, in this order"
true for a screen reader. `Tabs` renders `role="tablist"`, which says these swap a region, so the
composition was never right, only convenient.

**The last crumb is the page you are on, so it is a `<span>` with `aria-current="page"`.** Not a disabled
link, which would stay in the tab order and look pressable; not a button that does nothing. Which crumb is
current is positional, so the component decides it and hands the answer to the painter through
`BreadcrumbsFlags.isCurrent`.

**`isCurrent` is an extra flag rather than something the page recomputes.** `Tabs` lets its page derive
`isSelected` because selection is the consumer's state. Here it is not: only the component knows the crumb
count, so a page deriving "last one" would re-derive something known one level up and get it wrong the moment
a trail is trimmed.

**The item is a `<button>` without an `href` and an anchor with one**, with a `linkComponent` escape for a
router's link — the three-way shape `Tabs` and `Paginator` use, reusing `TabLinkProps`.

**Separators are the consumer's paint, live outside the item, and are `aria-hidden`** — otherwise a trail
reads as "Home slash Library slash Inputs". The slot is optional and renders no wrapper when absent.

**There is no keyboard handling at all, and that is correct.** Crumbs are independent destinations, so each
is its own tab stop, as `Paginator` records for its page numbers. A roving order would make the trail one
stop, which is what a `tablist` wants and a `nav` does not.

**Trimming the trail is the consumer's.** Raised by the user: pressing `B` in `A > B > C > D`
ought to leave `A > B`. The behaviour is right and so is the component — `onSelect` reports the press and
nothing else, since the component does not own the route and a trail that trimmed itself would fight a
router-driven consumer. The demo was wrong: it reported into a readout and left the trail at four. The page
now derives the trail from the pressed crumb's index, and the panel's `Reset` is the way back.

**Not built:** collapsing a long trail behind an overflow menu. It needs a decision about where the hidden
crumbs go, and nothing has asked.

### `RadioGroup` takes a floater, and both floater observers are guarded

Settled, straight after the segmented control below. A sliding indicator behind the chosen
segment cannot be painted from inside one radio: it needs the selected item's **box**, and a painter only
knows its own.

**The objection this had to clear was purity, and it does not survive.** `RadioGroup` already takes `dir` and
`gap` — it already decides where its children sit, so handing that measurement back out exposes something it
owns rather than teaching it something new.

**The mechanism is `Tabs`', copied deliberately rather than generalised**: a root ref, a `ResizeObserver`
watching the root and the selected item's `offsetParent`, the box written as inline `top` / `left` / `width` /
`height`, and `ElementFader` for entry and exit. Two consumers is not yet an `Abstract`; a third is when to
extract.

**The observer is now guarded on the prop, in both controls.** It previously ran for every `Tabs` on the
page, measuring for a floater nobody asked to render, and copying it unguarded into `RadioGroup` would have
put a `ResizeObserver` inside every radio group in every form. The effect returns early when `renderFloater`
is absent. Not guarded: `Tabs` keeps its item refs regardless, because arrow keys focus through them — only
the measuring is optional, and confusing the two would break the keyboard.

**Both roots carry `isolation: isolate`, and without it the floater escapes the control.** The floater sits
at `z-index: -1` so the items paint over it. A negative index resolves against the nearest ancestor that
starts a **stacking context**, and `position: relative` alone does not start one — so the floater travelled up
the ancestor chain until it found one, and any background painted on the way covered it. Exactly what happened
when the Playground put a background on the box wrapping the segmented strip: measured correctly, positioned
correctly, painted underneath the wrapper. `isolation: isolate` starts a stacking context and nothing else;
`z-index: 0` would work too but says something about the control's own order among its siblings, which is the
consumer's business. `Tabs` had the same latent fault and now carries the same line.

Worth knowing for the next painter: this class of fault is invisible to `e2e/`. The floater spec asserts the
measured box, which was right the whole time.

**The preset route was considered and rejected.** A segmented preset over `RadioGroup` owning the floater
privately resurrects as a component the thing just decided to be paint, for one optional prop's worth of
surface — and a preset existing to hide a prop the base already needs is a worse trade than the prop.

### A segmented control is `RadioGroup` paint, and the Radio page proves it

Settled, closing a `backlog.md` entry. A row of joined buttons with exactly one pressed reads
like `Tabs` and is not: `Tabs` is navigation and swaps which region is shown, while a segmented control holds
a **value** that is part of a form's answer. Same appearance, different meaning, and the role reflects the
meaning.

So it needs no component. `RadioPage`'s **Segmented** variant is the demonstration: `RadioGroup` with
`getDir` row and `getGap` zero, painted by `RadioSegmentContent` instead of `RadioContent`. **A segment paints almost nothing** — no
dot, no border, no background, only padding and a text colour that flips when checked.

**The strip's own look belongs to a wrapper, not to the segments.** `PageRadioSegmentGroup` is a plain
`<div>` around the whole `RadioGroup` carrying the border, background and outer radius, and the fill behind
the chosen segment is the floater. Segments drawing their own borders was tried first: it needed an `isFirst`
/ `isLast` pair so the ends could round and the inner dividers collapse, it made every segment opaque —
hiding the floater completely, since it sits behind at `z-index: -1` — and it put the strip's appearance in
three places. A container can round its own corners without knowing which child is first.

The library cannot be that wrapper: `RadioGroup` accepts no class name, so the page supplies its own box.
Library owns the roles and the geometry, page owns the paint.

**A rating input went the same way on the same day, and it is the more interesting of the two** because one
part genuinely is not `RadioGroup`. Five stars are five radios; the **preview** is not — hovering the third
star fills the first three. A painter cannot do that alone, because `isHovered` is its own and star two would
have to know star three's. The page holds it: a `hoveredRatingSignal` written from each `Radio`'s
`onMouseEnter` / `onMouseLeave`, each star filled when its number is at or below the hovered one, falling
back to the value. Nothing was added to the library — the preview was the argument for a `Rating` component
being more than paint, and it turned out to be **eight lines in the consumer**; a radio group's arrow keys
move the value itself, so the keyboard case needs no preview.

### The Playground theme is an example, and carries no rationale on purpose

Settled by the user, when asked whether `App/Theme.css.ts`'s token shape deserved an entry
here. It does not: **every value in it is as arbitrary as any consumer's own.** Four steps per colour rather
than a numeric ramp, one animation duration rather than a set, `half` / `full` / `double` / `quad` spacing —
none of it is a recommendation and none of it constrains the library, which paints nothing and reads no
token. A consumer copying its shape is copying an example.

This does **not** license changing it casually. It is the only theme the Playground has, so a token edit
repaints every page at once; the values being arbitrary is a statement about their origin, not an invitation
to churn them.

### The Playground's field look is one surface, and every field-shaped control wears it

Extracted, after the user pointed out that `TagInput` did not look like the other inputs — it
had 1px border instead of 2, a theme background instead of black, no shadow, its own padding.

`TextFieldContent.css` now exports **`fieldSurface`**: the border and its 25% currentColor, the radius, the
black fill, the small shadow, the transition, and the `isReadOnly` / `hasError` / `isHovered` / `isDisabled`
selectors. `textFieldContent` is `fieldSurface` plus the fixed 240×40 box and its `isStretched` escape;
`tagInputContent` is `fieldSurface` plus `position: absolute; inset: 0`, since there the tags size the box.
The flag classes are imported from the same file, so hover, error and disabled behave identically rather than
similarly.

The two shapes are why this is a shared **surface** and not a shared component: in `TextField` the painter
declares the size and the input is laid over it; in `TagInput` the content declares the size and the painter
is laid under it. Only the appearance is common. The metrics travel as the existing `FIELD_PADDING` /
`FIELD_GAP` / `FIELD_HEIGHT` constants, which `TagInput`'s page now passes — `FIELD_HEIGHT` through
`getMinHeight`, so an empty tag box is exactly as tall as a text field and grows from there.

**Width is deliberately not matched.** A text field is 240px because its painter says so; a tag box is as
wide as its tags, which is the documented behaviour of the control.

### A Playground demo a visitor can move must be a demo they can put back

Stated by the user, after `TagInput` and `Stepper` shipped with no way to restore them.
**If pressing something inside a variant changes state the page owns, the page ships a way back to where it
started.**

The reset lives in the **props panel**, not beside the variant, for the reason every other knob does: one
control governs every instance, so the page returns as a whole. The starting values move to module constants
and the reset writes them back.

**A knob that happens to express the state does not stand in for the button.** Confirmed by the user on
against the opposite guess: `Breadcrumbs` was left without one because its `Depth` field can
put the trail back, and they asked for the button anyway. A knob is somewhere to _set_ a value, and knowing
that setting it to 4 happens to be the starting point is knowledge the page has and the visitor does not. A
reset also resets everything the page moved: pressing a crumb moved the trail _and_ the readout under it.

The exception is a variant whose whole point is a one-way gesture with an owner-held latch, which is why
`SlideButton` keeps its `Reset` inside the card.

### `ScreenWiper`: CSS shapes, not SVG

Each wipe cell used to be a `<div>` wrapping an `<svg>` wrapping a `<polygon>` or
`<circle>` — three nodes per cell, with the polygon's `points` string rebuilt per cell. It is now one `<div>`
carrying `clip-path: polygon(...)` for the lozenge or `border-radius: 50%` for the circle, picked by a
`styleVariants` map. Measured at 1920×1080: **1370 elements down to 508**, pixel-identical (byte-for-byte
screenshot comparison).

**Collapsing into one `<svg>` with `<use>` was rejected.** It reaches a similar node count and shares the
geometry, but it moves several hundred animating elements inside one viewport-sized SVG. SVG has no
per-element compositing, so a transform change on any child invalidates the whole raster — trading a few
hundred cheap independent `div` transforms for a full-viewport repaint every frame. The node count was never
the expensive part; the concurrent staggered transitions are, and no restructuring changes that.

A tiled `<pattern>` does not apply whatever the node count: each cell scales on its own staggered delay, so
there is no repeating unit to tile.

`flex-shrink: 0` on the cell is load-bearing. The old markup got its size from the `<svg>`'s width attribute,
which ignored flex shrinking; a plain `div` would shrink and break the tessellation where a row overflows.

Not exercised: the `circle` shape has no Playground variant, so `border-radius: 50%` replacing `<circle>` is
reasoned, not observed.

### `CellAnimation`: weights as the staggering primitive

**A cell's weight is its position on the timeline.** A weight function returns 0..1 per cell from
`(pos, count, origin)`, and `computeBreakpoints(weight, opts)` turns that into the slice of the global
timeline the cell owns — direction is weight inversion, smoothness is the width of the window.

**The timing curve is the sample's, and it shapes a cell's own window rather than the whole timeline.**
`computeLocalTimeline` takes one of the five CSS timing functions — `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`,
`ease-in-out` — and applies it to the ratio a cell has travelled through its own slice, so the stagger keeps
the arrival order the weights decided and only the playback within each cell bends. It is solved as CSS
solves it, a cubic bezier inverted by Newton with a bisection fallback, so `ease` here and `ease` in a
stylesheet are the same curve rather than two approximations of it.

**Per-keyframe easing stays out, because the keyframe data can already express it.** CSS puts a timing
function on each keyframe, and that was the shape the React-era component had — but a stop list interpolated
linearly is exactly what `linear()` is, so an eased segment is written as denser stops in the sample rather
than as a second easing mechanism in the sampler. What denser stops cannot express is a curve over the
cell's whole window, which is why that is the half that got built.

**A source that is drawn rather than photographed is a data URI, and it needs nothing from the library.** The
component slices whatever URL it is handed, so an SVG written as a string — a gradient, a solid, a pattern —
is a first-class source: `data:image/svg+xml,` followed by `encodeURIComponent` of the markup. No base64 step;
the Playground has been doing this for its `Mosaic` samples all along, and `Samples/CellAnimationSources` is
the same trick for this component. Two things the SVG must do: declare `xmlns`, and state a `width` and
`height`, because the invisible anchor takes the box's aspect ratio from the image's intrinsic size — a
400×200 source at `width: 100%` in a 300px box measures 300×150, exactly as a photograph would.

**The cell's background URL is quoted, and that is what makes a drawn source work at all.** `encodeURIComponent`
escapes the quotes in the markup but leaves parentheses alone, and every interesting SVG has them — `hsl(...)`,
`rgb(...)`, an internal `url(#id)` reference. An unquoted CSS `url()` cannot take a literal parenthesis, so the
whole declaration is dropped: measured, **zero** cells painted a background while the anchor still sized the box
correctly, which is the failure that looks like the animation having broken rather than the source. Quoting the
value costs nothing for a path or a `blob:` URL and is what makes the drawn case reachable.

**The Playground shows three source kinds as three examples, each owning the one setting only it can
answer.** A photograph is picked per example rather than per page — `ScanlineAnimationPage`'s arrangement —
and the two drawn examples each carry a dropdown over `Shape`'s own gradient and pattern samples. Everything
the three share, the grid and the weights and the timing, stays in the page's own panel, since changing it is
meant to change all of them.

**A drawn example also picks its own shape, which the photograph cannot.** The two serialised sources are
written at whatever width and height they are handed, so `1:1`, `2:1` and `1:2` are a per-example dropdown over
`SOURCE_RATIO_SIZES` — the long side stays 1200 and the short one halves, so the default source is the same
1200×1200 it always was. `computeGradientSource` and `computePatternSource` take that size as an argument
rather than reading `SOURCE_SIZE`, since the rect, the sample's own `getSize` and the `<svg>` attributes all
have to agree on one number. A photograph's ratio is the file's, so the first example has no such control, and
the pattern's cell size is left at 150×150 — a wider source therefore shows more pattern cells rather than
stretched ones. The demo box takes its width from the ratio so the longest side is always the same 480: a
portrait source renders 240 wide rather than 960 tall.

**The palette and the animation length come from the same places the Shape page gets them.** The four
colours are `SVGDefsSamples.SAMPLE_COLORS`, which `ShapePage` now seeds its own editable store from rather
than declaring a second copy; the duration is the cell animation's own, passed in per call. What a sample then
does with that duration is the sample's business and is not normalised — the pointy-top hexagon runs its fill
cycle at four times what it is given, on the Shape page and here alike, so the numbers agree at the input
rather than at the output.

**A `Shape` def becomes a source by being rendered and serialised, which is `SVGDefsSources`.** The samples
are Solid callbacks returning live elements, so the helper renders them into a detached `<svg>`, adds a
full-size rect per entry filled from that entry's colour or `url(#id)`, serialises with `XMLSerializer`, and
disposes the reactive root. Nothing about the samples changes; the Shape page and the animation page ask the
same registry for the same thing.

**Whether a def still moves inside a source is decided by how its animation begins.** Loading an SVG through
an `src` runs no script but does run SMIL — measured: an `<animate>` with `begin="0s"` kept animating inside a
data URI while the same animation with `begin="indefinite"` sat frozen. The pattern samples carry a `dur` and
no `begin`, which defaults to zero, so they were always going to move. The gradient samples are driven by
`createAnimateDefs`, which sets `begin="indefinite"` on purpose and starts it from a ref that reads the
document's own clock, so that the iteration patterns can be sequenced.

**So the serialiser writes the timing into the markup, which is the whole of what a script would have done for
the common case.** With no iteration delay asked for, every `begin="indefinite"` becomes `begin="0s"` on the
way out. That is exact rather than
approximate wherever the iteration config is `constant`, because `constant` supplies no patterns at all: the
repeat count is already `indefinite` and the only thing missing was the start. It is a serialisation-time
rewrite rather than a change to the builders, and it is only correct because a source is a document nothing
will ever drive — the live `Shape` on a page still needs the script, which is what sequences its stages.

**The cell timeline is keyed on the picture as well as the iteration, so a new source starts it over.** Two
clocks are in play and only one of them can be restarted: the cells run on the page's frame loop, a drawn
source runs on the image's own timeline, which begins when the image loads. Rebuilding a source hands it a
fresh timeline while the cells carry on, so the offset between them becomes whatever the cells happened to be
doing — visible as a sweep sliding against the slicing. Treating a changed `src` as a reason to begin again
puts both back near zero together. Near, not exactly: the image's clock starts on load, so a slow source still
lands a frame or two behind, and nothing can hold them together after that.

**The pause between repeats is a begin that refers to the animation's own end.** The component waits on a
timer between runs; a document nothing drives has no timer, so the wait has to be stated. SMIL says it
declaratively: one repeat, and `begin="0s;<id>.end+<delay>ms"` — measured, the animation runs, freezes at its
end, holds through the pause and starts again. Every animation in the source is given an id and that begin
when a delay is asked for, which is why an overridden `repeatCount="indefinite"` is part of it: an animation
that never ends never reaches an end to start again from, so a repeat that never stops and a pause between
repeats are not two things that can both be true. At a delay of zero there is nothing to express and the
simpler continuous form comes back.

**Only the gradients take the pause; the patterns flow on.** Settled by the user, and the reason is what each
one looks like when it is out of step. A repeating fill has no beat — it tiles and cycles, so there is nothing
in it that can be seen to happen at the wrong moment, and a pause would only make it stutter against cells
that are resting for their own reasons. A gradient does have a beat: a sweep crosses the box once, and a sweep
crossing while the cells sit still reads as two things that were meant to agree and do not. So the delay is
passed for a gradient and pinned to zero for a pattern.

**What that does not reach is a multi-stage iteration pattern**, where the script advances a repeat count and
re-begins the animations after each stage ends. As a source, a def built that way plays its first stage and
freezes. Expressing the rest declaratively is possible — SMIL's syncbase timing works inside an image source,
measured: an animation beginning at `one.end+0.2s` ran after the one it names — so the chain would be one
`<animate>` per stage with a begin referring to the previous one's end, and a begin list to loop it. That is a
second variant of the builders rather than a rewrite of the existing one, and nothing has asked: the Playground
uses `constant` everywhere.

**The library names no weight and knows nothing about origins.** `CellAnimation` took
`getOriginType`, `getWeightType` and `getWeightOpts`, so the nine named origins and thirty-seven named
weights were the only ones a consumer could have. Wrong ownership: a consumer wanting an origin the library
never thought of, or a distribution driven by their own data, had no way in. All of them moved out of the component and into
`components/src/Samples` as sample code to copy, extend or ignore.

**The weights slot is a callback taking the count.** The grid the component draws is not the grid the
consumer asked for — the requested count is clamped against the measured pixel size, since cells thinner
than a pixel cannot draw. A weight grid built from the consumer's own numbers would be the wrong shape
whenever that clamp bites, and a wrong shape breaks indexing, so the component hands the effective count to
`computeCellWeights`. Missing weights fall back to `0` per cell rather than throwing.

**The origin never enters the library at all, not even as data on the defs.**
`CellAnimationEvaluationDefs` is `{ pos, count, weight, size }`; a consumer needing an origin merges their
own in at the call site, as the Playground's `DefaultExample` does. A threaded origin would be a value the
component stores, validates and re-renders on while never reading it — API surface that only forwards. The
consumer already holds the point, having computed the weights from it.

Two consequences. Whoever wants origin-aware zones or keyframes types their own defs as
`CellAnimationEvaluationDefs & { origin: Point2d }`, which is what `CellAnimationZones.isInZone` and
`CellAnimationKeyframes.computeAnimation` take. And a consumer whose origin is derived from the grid must
derive it from the count they requested, not the count the component settled on — the one place this shape
is weaker than threading the value.

**`ScanlineAnimation` is a preset over this, not a second engine.** A scanline is a 1×N grid, so a line is a
cell and `getLineCount` is the only prop it adds; the five orderings it used to own became the `sequence*`
weight functions, which are exact rather than approximate. It kept its own name and evaluator alias because
the line-shaped API reads better for the common case — the reasoning that makes `Toggle` a preset over
`Checkbox`.

**A preset that loses an axis drops what indexed on it rather than narrowing it.** A scanline is a single
column, so every weight reading `dist.x` collapses: measured on a single column of eleven with the origin pinned at
`{ x: 0, y: 0 }`, which is what the Playground's Scanline page does, thirteen give every line the same weight
(`lineColumn`, `lineColumnAlternate`, `lineColumnConvergent`, both `quadrant` entries, all six `radar` entries, and
all three `frame` forms, whose ring is zero for every cell of a single column) and three more fall to two
values (`entwineRow`, `rollRow`, `rollRowConvergent`), and
most survivors are a plain row ramp wearing a name like `spiral` or `checkered`. The distance-based
survivors are the only reason an origin would exist on a line, and a control meaningful for three of nine
options reads as broken. This used to be enforced in the library — `ScanlineAnimation` narrowed `weightType`
to `ORIGIN_FREE_WEIGHT_TYPES` and exposed no origin. With the vocabulary gone there is nothing to narrow, so
the constraint is now the Playground's: its Scanline page offers only origin-free weights and pins the
origin to `{ x: 0, y: 0 }`. A real loss — the type used to make the trap unreachable.

**Cell geometry is integral and the requested count is honoured exactly.** Edges are
`round(idx * total / count)`, so every cell starts on a whole pixel and the remainder is spread across the
row — 7 cells over 240px start at 0, 34, 69, 103, 137, 171, 206. This replaced two worse rules:
`ScanlineAnimation` snapped `lineCount` down to a divisor of the measured size, tiling exactly but silently
giving 80 lines when you asked for 119; `CellAnimation` used fractional sizes, which have no visual upside
and push a consumer toward a higher count purely to tile cleanly. The count is separately clamped to the
pixel dimension.

**Cells are still drawn one pixel larger than their slot, and integer edges did not make that redundant.**
The Playground renders inside `Viewport`'s `transform: scale()`, so whole-pixel layout edges land on
fractional device pixels, the browser antialiases each cell independently, and hairline seams appear. This
was removed once on the reasoning that exact tiling made it unnecessary and had to go straight back — the
seams were visible on screen, and reasoning about sub-pixel rounding is not a substitute for looking. Only
the drawn box grows: positions, `background-position` and the logical span stay exact, so the extra pixel
repeats the neighbour's first column rather than shifting the slicing. `defs.size` reports the drawn box,
because that is what a percentage `translateX` resolves against.

**Whole-grid operations cannot live in a per-cell evaluator**, which is why weights are computed once per
count rather than per frame: `shouldMakeUnique` and `shouldNormalize` rank every cell against every other,
and memoising the grid also stops `randomDefault` reshuffling every frame. The component owns that memo and
calls the consumer's function to fill it.

**Grid geometry belongs to `ss-utils`.** The per-axis distance between two cells, the clamp of a point into
a grid, and the distance from a cell to the further of its two edges are `Point2dUtils.getDelta`,
`getBoundPoint` and `getFarthestBound`, added in `ss-utils` 0.0.20 for exactly this. `CellAnimationUtils`
keeps only the parity predicates (`isEvenRow`, `isEvenColumn`, `isEvenRing`, `isEvenCheckered`), which read
a distance rather than measure one.

**`getFarthestBound` is not a drop-in for the old `getMaxDistance`.** It reports the honest `0` on a
single-cell grid where the original floored at `1`. Every distance-based weight divides by that number, so
the floor is what stops a 1×1 grid producing `Infinity` — a property of the weight functions rather than the
geometry, so it lives in `CellAnimationWeights.const.ts`. `computeCellWeights` is pinned on a 1×1 grid so a
future simplification that drops it fails loudly.

**An anchor is a translate, not a new value key.** Scaling or rotating about an anchor `a` equals the
centre-anchored transform `M` plus a translate of `(I - M)·a`, and translate percentages resolve against the
element's own unscaled border box — so `transform-origin` folds into `translateX` / `translateY` inside
`fromStops` and never reaches the result type. Exact rather than an approximation, and it generalises to 3D:
with `perspective` on the **parent**, a 3D rotation folds the same way using `translateZ`. It does **not**
work with the `perspective()` transform function on the element itself, which puts the vanishing point at
that element's own `transform-origin`, so moving the origin changes the projection. Perspective on the
parent is also the better rendering: one shared vanishing point is a 3D scene, per-element perspective is N
independent cards.

**Transform functions are emitted in a fixed order** — perspective, matrix, translate, rotate, skew, scale,
with each family's axis variants together — because `translateX(50%) scaleX(50%)` and its reverse are
different matrices, so ordering by `Object.entries` would make composition depend on the key order of a
literal the consumer wrote. Filters are ordered by `CSS_FILTER_KEYS`, and the transform/filter split is
decided by those lists rather than by the ordering constant, so a key nobody listed cannot end up in the
wrong string. `assignAnimationProps` always assigns both properties, so a frame that stops producing a
filter clears the previous one, and it zips each value against `CSSConst.ANIMATION_UNITS[key]`, one entry per
function argument.

**A component that computes a `z-index` owes the page a stacking context.** Cells carry a per-cell
`z-index` from weight so earlier ones layer above later ones while they overlap; without
`isolation: isolate` on the container those values escape into the nearest ancestor stacking context. In the
Playground they landed in the stress test modal's context and painted over its FPS counter.

### The animation sample collections: `fromZones`, and why a fifth circle is not worth adding

**Adding members to an existing family stops paying off, and the reason is structural rather than a matter of
taste.** A weight function is one number per cell that does not change while the animation runs, so any weight
that falls away smoothly from a point is a wipe, and there are only so many shapes a wipe can be — round,
square, diamond, banded, spiral. A keyframe sample is a function of one cell's own progress that ends with the
cell in place, so it is always an entrance. Two batches of new entries were built against the existing
collection and the user's verdict on most of them was that they look repetitive, which is the expected outcome
of adding a fifth circle rather than a failure of the individual samples. **What pays off instead is machinery
that recombines what is already there**: an operator over any weight, or a combinator over any two animations,
multiplies the collection without adding anything that looks like its neighbour. `shouldMakeUnique` and
`shouldNormalize` on `computeCellWeights` are already this pattern, and `fromZones` is the first one on the
animation side. Ideas of that kind, graded but not built, are in `backlog.md` under **_Open discussion_**.

**The three ring metrics are diamond, circle and rectangle, and two of them were called the wrong thing.** What
separated the family that was called `circular`, the one called `quadratic`, and `radial` is only how a cell's
distance from the origin is measured: the `circular` family took the mean of the two axis distances, so its
rings are diamonds standing on a corner, and it is now `diamond` — the word this file already used when it
listed the shapes a wipe can be. `radial` takes the true straight-line distance, so its rings are the only
actual circles in the collection, and it gained the third form the other two had, `radialConvergent`, built
from `diamondConvergent`'s shape with the straight-line distance. `quadratic` took the larger of the two axis
distances, so its rings are squares — and that turned out to be one half of a pair rather than a family of its
own, which is the entry below.

**`frame` is one metric with three normalisations, and it absorbed both `quadratic` and the old
border-anchored `frame`.** The metric is the larger of the two axis distances, so its rings are nested
rectangles around the origin, and what differs is only what that distance is divided by. `frameFarthest`
divides by the larger of the two maximum distances, so the ring stays square and grows until it reaches the
farthest edge, overshooting the short axis on the way. `frameNearest` divides by the smaller, so the square
stops at the nearest edge. `frameStretched` divides each axis by its own maximum, so the ring is pulled to the
grid's own proportions and all four edges are reached at once. `quadratic` was the Farthest one all along, under
a name that described neither the shape nor the family.

**What `frameNearest` costs is worth knowing before it is judged, because the clamp hides it.** Everything
outside the square that fits inside the grid lands below zero and is clamped, so all of it starts at the same
moment: measured on a twenty-one by seven grid with a centred origin, forty-nine of a hundred and forty-seven
cells carry the ramp and the other ninety-eight arrive together. On a square grid it is identical to
`frameFarthest`. It is here because the user asked for the nearest-edge member by name, having been told first
what it does to a wide grid.

**What that cost, and why it was still the right trade.** The `frame` that existed before measured its rings
from the grid's border inward and ignored the origin entirely, which is a different idea rather than a second
normalisation — a shared name with the origin-anchored metric would have hidden the larger difference. The
user chose the pair, so the border-anchored behaviour is gone, and with it `frame`'s place in
`ORIGIN_FREE_WEIGHT_TYPES` and therefore on the Playground's Scanline page. Measured before removing it, all
three of its forms gave every line of a single column the same weight, so the Scanline page lost nothing it
could show.

**Each member keeps its own ring parity, which is what `Alternate` and `Convergent` turn on.** `isEvenRing`
answers "is this cell's square ring an even one", so `frameNearest` and `frameFarthest` use it unchanged;
`frameStretched`'s rings are stretched rectangles, so it asks the same question of its own metric —
`isEvenStretchedRing`, the parity of the rounded stretched distance. Using `isEvenRing` for all three would have
banded a wide grid's stretched entries across rings the ramp does not follow.

**Handedness is an axis of an existing family, not a family of its own.** `_sweepCw` and `_sweepCcw` were a
second implementation of the thing `radar` already does — one arm turning about the origin — and measured, with
the origin at a corner they and `radarSingle` order the hundred and twenty-one cells identically to within a
rounding error, so nothing on the page could tell them apart. At a centred origin they do differ, but only in
which ray the arm starts from and which way it turns: `radarSingle` starts at six o'clock and turns
counter-clockwise, `_sweepCw` starts at twelve and turns clockwise. Sweep also spaces the arm by true angle
where radar spaces it by how far round the square ring a cell sits, which is a few percent of one cell's start
time and not a difference anybody was going to see. So both sweeps went and the handedness they were carrying
became `radarSingleCw`, `radarDoubleCw` and `radarQuadCw`, which reaches Double and Quad as well — something
a one-armed sweep could never have done. The three existing radar entries keep their names and are the
counter-clockwise ones.

**A mirrored sample reflects its input rather than growing a parameter.** A clockwise entry is
`radar` called with the position reflected across the vertical line through the origin —
`getMirroredPos`, `x' = origin.x * 2 - pos.x`. The reflection leaves the distance the maths runs on untouched,
since `|origin.x - (2 * origin.x - x)|` is `|x - origin.x|`, and flips only which side each quadrant test lands
on, which is the whole of what handedness means here. So no branch went into the util, its arity did not grow
past a signature this file already calls readable only to its own callers, and the same one-line reflection reaches
`spiral` unchanged if a clockwise spiral is ever wanted.

**A quadrant pair names the two corners it grows from, which `Default` could not.** The entry that was called
`quadrantDefault` multiplied the two signed distances, so the product is negative in the two quadrants where the signs disagree
and those corners start first — the top-right and the bottom-left, which are the two ends of a rising diagonal.
It is therefore `quadrantUp`, and `quadrantDown` is the same expression with that product added instead of
subtracted, so it starts from the top-left and the bottom-right. The direction words are the ones the diagonal
band entries already use, so the pair reads off the same vocabulary rather than inventing `Mirrored`.

**The diagonal is a band direction, and it was the one thing the collection had none of.** Diagonals were not
absent so much as never straight: `diamond`'s rings are four diagonal segments meeting at corners, and
`checkered`'s two passes alternate on the parity of `dist.x + dist.y`, which is a diagonal parity. What nothing
produced was a band whose edge is a single 45° line — the thing `lineRow` and `lineColumn` are, turned
half a right angle.

**One rotated coordinate pair covers every family that had a Row and a Column.** `getDiagonalDelta` returns
`down`, which is `|dx - dy|` and counts bands parallel to a line falling to the right, and `up`, which is
`|dx + dy|` and counts bands parallel to one rising to the right. That is all the new arithmetic there is,
because every one of these families is the same three ingredients: a band index, a position along the band,
and the parity of the band index. `lineRow` is `(dist.y, dist.x, isEvenRow)`; `_lineDiagonalDown` is
`(down, up, isEven(down))`, and the Up member swaps the pair over. So `line` gained all three forms, `roll`
gained its two and `entwine` gained one each way, from two helpers and no new formula.

**Each direction gets its own maximum, worked out rather than bounded.** `maxDist.x + maxDist.y` is an upper
bound for both diagonals and is exact for neither: with the origin in a corner of an eleven by eleven grid the
down-diagonal only reaches ten, so that bound would have left half the weight range unused and the wipe would
finish halfway through its stagger. `getMaxDiagonalDistance` takes the larger of the two corner sums per
direction instead.

**Two of the four families degenerated on a diagonal basis, and the fix was to normalise along the band.** In
the rotated basis `down + up` is always even, so a cell's two diagonal distances always share a parity. `roll`
and `entwine` use the band index for nothing but its parity, so that parity was the parity of the coordinate
the ramp already ran on, and the weight collapsed into a function of one coordinate — a banded diagonal wipe.
For `roll` the collapse was exact: measured, `rollDiagonalUp` came out byte-identical to
`lineDiagonalDownAlternate` on every grid and origin tried, and `rollDiagonalDown` to `lineDiagonalUpAlternate`.

**What broke the collapse is dividing the position along a band by that band's own length.** Every row is as
long as every other, so `rollRow` can divide by the grid's width and nothing is lost; diagonal bands are all
different lengths, so dividing by the longest left short bands using a sliver of their range — and left the
band index out of the value, which is what allowed the collapse. `getMaxDiagonalDistanceInBand` answers how far
the along-band coordinate reaches inside one band, by intersecting the band with the grid and evaluating at the
two ends, which is exact because the distance along a band is convex. After it, no two diagonal entries are
equal on any grid or origin tried, and `roll` and `entwine` each vary within a band as well as across bands.
It reads off both signed bands at the same distance, because these families index a band by distance and treat
the two sides of the origin as one, exactly as `lineRow` treats the rows above and below it.

**`zigzag` is the one family with no diagonal member, and the reason is a ratio it cannot change.** Its
along-band term is one part in `bandCount + 1` of the range whatever it is divided by, and a diagonal basis has
about twice as many bands as a row basis on a square grid — eleven against six on eleven by eleven. So the
diagonal snake deviated from a plain diagonal wipe by at most 0.091 where the row snake reaches 0.167, and
per-band normalisation could not widen that, only let every band sweep its own length. The user looked and
deleted both entries: a snake that reads as a straight diagonal wipe is a fifth circle. `roll` and `entwine`
kept theirs, because for them the same normalisation was the difference between a duplicate and a pattern.

**The origin moves a diagonal wipe only across its bands, which is the family's own behaviour rather than a
gap.** `lineRow` reads `dist.y` alone, so sliding the origin sideways changes nothing; a diagonal reads its own
band index alone, so sliding the origin along the band changes nothing — measured, `_lineDiagonalDown` is
identical at `center` and at `topLeft`, both being on the same falling line.

**Ripple and the concentric families were deliberately left out of this.** The user axed ripple's row and
column entries in the same breath as asking for diagonals, on the grounds that ripple is for concentric
patterns; the same reasoning keeps a diagonal out of `radial`, `diamond` and the three `frame` members, whose
whole subject is a ring around a point.

**`oval` is not one of them, and reading it as one was a mistake made from its name.** `ovalRow` is
`zigzagRow`'s even branch with the parity flip removed: rows are the bands, the ramp runs along each row from
the origin's column, and every row sweeps the same way. The frontier that gives it its name is curved because
the two terms compound, not because anything measures a radius. It is therefore a band family and does take a
diagonal member — the caution about rings never applied to it.

**Its diagonal member was built, measured and deleted, on `zigzag`'s ratio.** With a centred origin, `ovalRow`
differs from `lineRow` by up to 0.167 on eleven by eleven and 0.250 on twenty-one by seven, while the diagonal
member differed from `lineDiagonalDown` by 0.091 and 0.071 — the second figure worse, because a wide grid has
few rows and many diagonal bands. That is the same 0.091 that had both `zigzagDiagonal` entries deleted, so
`oval` and `zigzag` are the two band families with no diagonal, for one reason rather than two.

**A sequence starts at the origin, which is the whole of what an origin can mean to an ordering.** `sequenceMorton`
and `sequenceStride` were indexed on absolute grid coordinates, so the Origin control did nothing for them.
Morton now interleaves the bits of the distance from the origin rather than of the position, so the Z-curve
grows out of the origin — and at an origin of `{ x: 0, y: 0 }` the distance is the position, so it reproduces
exactly what it used to do. Stride rotates its walk so the origin's own cell is the one that arrives first.
Both consequences are worth stating: they leave `ORIGIN_FREE_WEIGHT_TYPES`, and with it the Playground's
Scanline page, whose list is exactly that array; and the user had already said they do not look good on a
scanline, so the removal went with their leaning rather than against it. Putting them back on that page means
the page naming them, not the array.

**Stride's axis is which way the flat index runs, not how long the step is.** `sequenceStrideRow` counts the
index along rows and `sequenceStrideColumn` along columns, which is the `lineRow`/`lineColumn` pair applied to
an ordering. The step itself stays the golden-ratio one, stepped down until it shares no factor with the total
so that the walk visits every cell exactly once — a shorter step was offered as a second axis and not taken,
so `stride` takes the total and the origin's index and owns the step.

**`random` is a group of two, because reseeding made a third one redundant.** `randomDefault` draws per cell
and `randomClustered` interpolates a hash over four-cell blocks, which is the only one that can give a smooth
blob. A flat hash of the cell's coordinates was built as well, and its only distinction from `randomDefault` was
that it repeated; once the user chose a pattern that never repeats, a freshly seeded flat hash is a slower
`Math.random()` giving a statistically identical picture, so it was dropped rather than kept as a duplicate.
`randomClustered` takes a seed, and the seed is drawn once per `computeCellWeights` call: a cluster needs
neighbouring cells to agree on it, and a never-repeating pattern cannot fix it at module load either. That is
the one piece of mutable state in the collection, it lives in `CellAnimationWeightUtils` beside the hash, and
`FIXED_HASH_SEED` is there for the callers that want the opposite — `_computeHorizontalDropout` picks which
scanlines drop out and is called every frame, so a seed that moved would reshuffle the dropout mid-animation.

**Ripple is a cosine over a distance, and everything that varies is an argument.** The `ripple` util takes the
spread, the spread's maximum, the period in cells and a travel ratio, and each entry is that call with its own
distance measure. Eight were built to be looked at and four survived the first pass: straight bands along a row
or a column and rings on the square metric were all discarded, and the diamond metric was kept — so the family
is now two metrics, the straight-line distance and the diamond one, each with the same variants. The period
gives `Tight` at two cells and `Wide` at eight, and the travel ratio gives `Travelling`, which mixes the bands
with a falloff so the rings arrive in order outward instead of all at once — the difference between one wave
crossing the grid and a set of standing rings. `rippleDefault` and `rippleDiamondDefault` are the two the user
has kept, and the plain-distance entries carry no metric word in their names for the same reason the
counter-clockwise `radar` entries carry no handedness: the unmarked name is the one that was there first.

**A sample selector is sorted alphabetically, always.** The user's rule, given after a batch of new animations
sat unsorted at the end of the dropdown. It covers every list a Playground control reads from — the weight and
animation registries and the `SVGDefs` gradient and pattern registries, whose keys are what their dropdowns
show. Sorting is by the name with any review marker stripped, which is also how the Playground groups, so a
marked entry sits beside the family it belongs to rather than in a block of its own at one end. The registry
records are sorted the same way as the type arrays, so there is one order to maintain rather than two.

**Three lists are exempt, confirmed by the user, because their order carries meaning.** `ORIGIN_TYPES` walks
the centre and then clockwise, `EASINGS` runs in the order CSS names them, and `ZONE_TYPES` groups by kind.
Alphabetising any of the three would scatter something a reader uses to find an entry, which is the opposite of
what the rule is for. The rule is about collections whose order is otherwise arbitrary.

**A directional family names its members after the direction each one travels or the edge it turns on, and its
quadrant entry reads that word off the zone.** `swing` pivots on an edge, so its members are `swingTop`,
`swingBottom`, `swingLeft` and `swingRight`, and `swingDefault` became `swingTop` once there was more than one.
`tumble`, `shoot`, `shake`, `drip` and `hop` are named for where the cell is heading, so they gained the missing
directions under `Up`, `Down`, `Left` and `Right`, and `dripDefault` became `dripDown` for the same reason
`swingDefault` had to go: a family of four with one member called Default cannot say which one it is. Their
quadrant entries dispatch outward — a cell above the origin travels up — which is the mapping `elasticUp` and
`pullUp` already had against the `top` zone.

**An entrance starts hidden, by opacity or by geometry, and `skew` was the one entry that did not.** A cell
animation runs from a weight-decided moment to the cell at rest, so at its first stop the cell must not be
visible — otherwise the whole grid shows the picture before anything animates, and the stagger is invisible.
Most entries satisfy this by scaling from nothing (`zoomIn`, the `pop` family, `pull`, `swarm`, `encircle`) and
the rest by opening at `opacity: 0` and reaching `100` a fifth of the way in. `skewCw` and `skewCcw` did
neither: they began at full size and full opacity with a 45 degree skew, so every cell was already there.
Checked at the same time, those two were the only entries in the collection that started visible.

**Where an entry can hide itself by geometry, that beats an opacity fade, and the user's reason is what it looks
like at full size.** A cell that fades in at its final dimensions reads as the shape appearing rather than
arriving — the eye is given a large rectangle that simply gains substance. So `skew` hides by scaling from
nothing instead, and the shear it unwinds went from 45 degrees to 75 to keep the entry recognisably a skew now
that a growing cell carries most of the movement. Transforms are written scale-last, so the shear is applied to
an already-scaled cell and a 75 degree lean on a nearly-zero-size cell stays local rather than smearing across
the grid. Opacity is still right where nothing about the geometry can hide the cell, which is what `cube`,
`flip` and `swing` do — they rotate in place at full size.

**A quadrant entry has an `Inverted` twin, which is the same zones pointing at the opposite members.** Where the
plain entry sends a cell outward — above the origin travels up — the inverted one sends it inward, so `top` takes
the Down member, `left` takes the Right one, and for the two diagonal families each quadrant and axis takes the
member diagonally opposite. Nothing new is animated: an `Inverted` entry is its twin's list with the members
swapped in pairs, which is why all thirteen came from one mapping. `pop` keeps `popCenter` as its fallback and
the rest keep `zoomIn`, exactly as their plain twins do.

**A pair that differs only in handedness or in axis can be mixed by a zone, and that is two entries rather than
a new animation.** `encircle`, `skew`, `swarm`, `spinUp` and `spinDown` each hold a clockwise and a
counter-clockwise member; `pull` and `flip` each hold a horizontal and a vertical one. Every one of those pairs
gained a `Rings` entry, which gives the even square rings the first member and the odd rings the second, and a
`Checkered` entry, which splits them by checkerboard parity instead. Both come free of new keyframes:
`evenRings` and `evenCheckeredCells` were already in the zone vocabulary, and `fromZones` already dispatches on
it. This is the _"machinery that recombines what is already there"_ argument applied to the animation side a
second time, and the reason it pays is that neither member changes — what changes is which cell gets which.

**`fromZones` takes an ordered list and an explicit fallback**, not a record keyed by zone. Zones overlap by
design — `top` is every cell above the origin including the corners, and the four quadrants exclude the two
axes entirely — so first-match-wins is the only contract that stays predictable, and the order is part of what
a sample is saying. The fallback is required rather than defaulting to no animation: a cell that matched
nothing would otherwise sit fully visible and motionless while the rest of the grid assembles, which reads as
a defect rather than as a choice.

**A zone entry picks the family member of the same name, and where no such member exists the family does not
get a zone entry.** So the `top` zone takes `carouselTop`, `hingeTop`, `elasticUp` and `pullUp`, and the
top-left quadrant takes `popTopLeft` and `rollUpLeft`. `spin` is the family deliberately left without one: its
four members are two directions times two handednesses rather than four positions, so any mapping onto
quadrants would be invented here rather than read off the names.

**A diagonal family needs the four axis zones as well as the four quadrants.** The quadrants leave out every
cell sharing a row or a column with the origin, which on an odd grid with a centred origin is a cross of
twenty-one cells out of a hundred and twenty-one — enough to look broken if they all fall through to the
fallback. `rollQuadrant` maps each axis to the quadrant member clockwise after it, and only the origin cell
itself reaches the fallback. A family with a centre member — `pop` has `popCenter` — needs no axis entries,
because the fallback is already the right answer for the whole cross.

**Entries the user has not yet groomed carry a leading underscore.** Asked for so that a batch of new samples
can be found and judged against the existing collection in one pass; it is a review marker rather than a
naming convention, and it comes off when an entry is kept. The Playground's option grouping strips it before
grouping, so `_carouselQuadrant` sat inside the `carousel` group next to the four members it dispatches to
while it was under review, rather than in a group of its own — which is the comparison the prefix exists to
make possible. Nothing in the `CellAnimation` collections carries it now; the `ScanlineAnimation` keyframe
builders still do.

### Controls: `Toasts`, and a queue the consumer owns

The shape question `backlog.md` parked toasts on rested on a premise that does not
hold here.

**`backlog.md` claimed toasts needed "an out-of-tree queue and an API that is called rather than bound,
which nothing here has". Both halves were already covered.** "Out of tree" is a signal created outside any
component — `createRoot(() => createSignal<Toast<T>[]>([]))`, which `Viewport.context.ts` already does — so
the list outlives whatever raised a notification without the library owning anything. "Called rather than
bound" is what a signal's setter is: `queue[1]((prev) => [...prev, toast])` is an imperative call from
arbitrary code with no component in scope. What the note reached for is sugar — `toast.error("…")` — which is
a layer for a consumer who has been met, and a library that has not met them should not pick their
vocabulary.

So the prop is `toastsSignal: Signal<Toast<T>[]>`, per _"Signal tuples for two-way state"_ in
`conventions.md`.

**The division of writes is what makes the two-way signal correct rather than convenient.** The consumer is
the only thing that adds; the component is the only thing that removes — a duration elapsing, and the limit
being exceeded. `Modal`'s `visibilitySignal` argument with a list instead of a boolean.

It also settles an ownership question no other shape answers cleanly. If the consumer owned the list outright
and the component only reported, "show at most three" would be enforced consumer-side, making queue policy
the consumer's job when policy is behaviour and behaviour is the shell's. If the component owned the list
privately, nothing could raise a toast without a handle to a mounted component. A shared signal is the only
arrangement where the component enforces policy by writing something the consumer can see.

**A controller handed over at mount is deliberately not used.** The `onMount` shape issues commands to a
mounted thing; a queue is state, and state that must outlive the mount cannot be reached through a handle the
mount gives out.

**The component keeps everything with a clock**: the enter transition (`ElementFader` unchanged), the
retention window during which an entry already gone from the consumer's list stays mounted to play its exit,
the auto-dismiss duration and its pausing, and the limit.

**Duration lives on the record and nowhere else — there is no component-wide default.** `Toast<T>` is
`{ id, value, durationMs? }`, and an absent `durationMs` means the toast waits to be dismissed. A default
prop would make per-toast stickiness inexpressible, since `undefined` would then read as "use the default"
and there would be no second spelling for "never" that was not a magic number. A consumer wanting four
seconds everywhere puts it in the push helper they already have. This is _"the absent value is the mode"_
from `Progress`, and it fails visibly.

**`id` is a separate field rather than identity living on `value`.** `Tabs` keys on `value` because two tabs
with the same value are meaningless; two identical toasts are meaningful — "Saved" twice in a row — so keying
on value would collapse them or make a change look like no change.

**One piece of internal state: the ordered list of rendered ids**, the admitted list plus the ids still
playing their exit. Everything else derives — an id absent from the admitted list is leaving. Ids are
strings, so `<For>` keys them by value and each entry keeps a stable node whatever the consumer does with
record references; the problem that forced `Tabs` onto `<Index>` does not arise. The record for an id is
latched inside the `<For>` callback, so an entry keeps painting its last known content while it fades.

**An unexported `ToastsItem` leaf per entry**, in the `TabsItem` shape, owning its own `ElementFader` and
duration timer so both are disposed with the entry rather than accumulating in a container that lives as long
as the application. It reports upward once its exit has finished and the container drops the id then.

**The duration timer arms and disarms through `onCleanup` inside its own effect, which is load-bearing.**
The first version cleared a timeout at the top of the effect and measured elapsed time only when pausing, so
the clock restarted from full whenever the effect re-ran — and it re-ran on every array change, because it
read whether the entry was exiting. Three toasts raised together therefore dismissed one and reset the other
two, indefinitely. Arming inside the effect and subtracting the elapsed time in its cleanup makes the
arithmetic correct regardless of _why_ the effect re-runs, and shrinks the dependency set to the duration and
whether it is paused. Found by driving the page, invisible to every type and DOM assertion.

**Pausing is region-wide and forced.** Hovering or focusing anywhere in the region holds every countdown;
there is no prop to switch it off. Focus is the half that matters — a toast must not vanish out from under
the button someone is reaching for. The listeners are `mouseover` / `mouseout` and `focusin` / `focusout` on
the region with a `relatedTarget` containment guard, **not** `mouseenter` / `mouseleave`, because the region
is `pointer-events: none` and is never itself a hit-test target; bubbling from the entries is the only thing
that reaches it.

**Urgency is per toast, and announcing is the announcer's job rather than the visible region's.** A live
region carries one politeness for everything inside it and there is no way to mark one child as more urgent
than its box, so an error could not interrupt while a confirmation waited its turn. `computeAnnouncement` is
the way out: given it, `Toasts` announces each arrival through `LiveAnnouncer` at that toast's own
`ariaLive` — falling back to the region-wide `ariaLive` as the default — and the visible region carries no
politeness at all. This is Radix's arrangement, reached from the same constraint.

**It is a branch on prop presence, and the branch is deliberate rather than lazy.** Without
`computeAnnouncement` the region keeps its own `aria-live` and behaves exactly as before, because the library
does not own the toast's text and cannot start announcing on a consumer's behalf — and silently _stopping_
announcements for a consumer who has already shipped would be an accessibility regression they would never
see. So the mode is chosen by whether the consumer has said what to announce.

**Both announcer regions are reserved when the stack mounts.** A live region only announces what is inserted
after it is already in the document, so a region created by the first message may be silent for exactly that
message — the failure that is hardest to notice, because everything after it works. `LiveAnnouncer.reserve`
exists for this: it creates a region without saying anything into it.

**The keyboard route in is `F8`, and `Escape` is the way back.** A toast is portalled to the end of the
document, so nothing tabs to it in any order a reader would expect; the published answer is a hotkey, and
Radix's default is the one adopted. The region takes `tabindex="-1"` so the key can focus it, the element
focused before the press is remembered, and `Escape` from anywhere inside hands focus back there. A consumer
with two stacks on one page sets `hotkey` to an empty string on the one that should not answer — the only
spelling for "no hotkey", since an absent prop has to mean the default.

**A toast's own `onShow` and `onHide` are `Modal`'s pair, at the same two boundaries.** They fire when the
entry transition starts and when the exit transition starts, not when either finishes, because that is what
`ElementFader` reports and what `Modal` already means by those names. The consumer owns the list, so arrivals
and departures are already visible to them; what an effect over their own array cannot see is the transition
boundary, which is the whole of what these two add.

### `Toasts`: what the painter gets, and why position is not fully delegated

**`renderToast(getToast, getVisibilityTarget, getTransitionDurationMs, getState)` opens with `Modal`'s
contract, in `Modal`'s order.** A consumer's toast painter and their modal painter are the same kind of
object — something that transitions itself between two states over a duration it was handed — and spelling
that two ways would be one contract under two shapes. Four arguments is not new:
`InteractionTooltipDefs.renderContent` already takes four with the same ordering. `getToast` is an accessor
and comes first, following `Tabs.renderTab`, because a consumer may replace the record for an id
("Uploading" becoming "Uploaded") and the painter must see that without remounting and restarting the entry
animation.

**`ToastState` is `{ index, count, isPaused }`, and those are the stacking hints.** The number of cards in
front of an entry is `count - 1 - index`, and newest-ness is a comparison against the ends. `index` is queue
position, oldest first, independent of `getDir` — the consumer sets the direction so they can map it to
visual order. Both are inside the reactive record rather than passed plain like `Tabs.renderTab`'s index,
because they change while an entry is mounted: removing the first toast renumbers everything behind it.
`isPaused` is there so a painter drawing a countdown can hold it; the countdown itself is the painter's, for
`Progress`'s reason.

**Nothing says _why_ an entry is leaving** — elapsed, closed, or pushed out by the limit. A painter drawing
those differently would animate a distinction the reader cannot act on.

**Nothing carries a dismiss action, and that is not an omission.** The consumer owns the signal, so the close
button their painter draws removes the entry from their own list, and the exit still plays because the
component holds the entry through it.

**Position cannot be fully delegated, and the reason is the live region rather than the geometry.** A
notification region only announces content inserted into it if the element was already in the document, so it
has to be a persistent element the component mounts once and keeps — and it has to be the component's, by the
rule that keeps `Select`'s `<div role="group">` out of consumer markup, with more force here because a
subtly wrong live region fails silently. Given that, delegating its position would mean accepting a class name
or a style object, and `TextInput` already argued that out: it accepted a whitelisted style object _only_
because text the browser draws had no other hook. Here there is another hook, used by three components —
`Modal` with `getAlignment` / `getMargins`, `Drawer` with `getEdge`, `Label` with `getDir` / `getGap`. Per
`Modal`: placement is geometry, not paint.

So the region is a viewport-sized layer in the `Viewport` portal that paints nothing and clicks through, and
four geometry props place the stack inside it: `getAlignment` (nine positions), `getDir` (which end new
entries enter from, and whether the stack runs down an edge or along one), `getGap` and `getMargins`. Each
entry sits in a minimal library box that re-enables pointer events and is the flex item; it carries no role,
since politeness is set once on the region and a role per entry would announce twice.

**Alignment is independent of direction, and `ToastsUtils.computeStackAlignment` keeps it that way.** A
reversed flex direction inverts "start" on the main axis, so a naive mapping would make `bottom-right` name
different corners depending on `getDir`. The function flips the main axis alone — exact arithmetic over two
enums, and the one part of this component reachable from `npm test`.

**Flow stacking is the geometry props; an overlapping pile is the painter's**, offsetting and scaling itself
off `index` and `count`, which works for a fixed peek distance. Overlapping by each card's own measured
height does not work and is in `backlog.md` rather than half-solved.

**Toasts sit above dialogs** — `z-index` 200 against `Modal`'s 100 — because a toast routinely reports the
outcome of the action a dialog just took.

**`getLimit` is written out as `Accessor<number | undefined>`** for the `AccessorProps` hole: an optional
prop whose value may be `undefined` cannot pass through the mapped type, and "no limit" is a value a consumer
switches to at runtime rather than a prop they omit. `getAriaLabel` is **required**, since a `role="region"`
with no name is not exposed as a landmark at all.

**`getOverflow` keeps both queue behaviours rather than picking one.** `dismiss-oldest` writes the excess out
of the consumer's list so the newest is on screen; `hold-newest` renders only the limit and leaves the rest
queued, entering as slots free. Genuinely different products — latest-news versus lose-nothing — and the
request for a prop rather than a default is why both exist. Held entries are not rendered at all, so they run
no clock, which falls out of the design.

### Controls: `Collapsible`, and what an accordion adds to one

Settled, on the user's call, when a single show-more panel became the second consumer of
machinery `Accordion` had kept to itself. The split is **what each layer claims about the page** rather than
how either one opens.

**`Collapsible` owns the disclosure**: the trigger's `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`, the panel, the
measured height, the fader, and `inert` while closed. `expandedSignal: Signal<boolean>` is its state — a lone
panel genuinely owns its own boolean.

**`Accordion` adds the three things that make a panel part of a set**, each a statement rather than a
behaviour: the heading element around the trigger, the panel's `role="region"` named by that trigger, and the
arrow-key walk across the headers. The expanded-set policy, including single-expand, stays with it too, since
only a set can have a policy.

**The heading is the load-bearing half of that split.** A show-more at the end of a paragraph is a control
inside prose; wrapping it in an `h3` puts a heading in the document outline that no reader would agree is
one, and a `region` landmark for a two-sentence expansion is landmark noise. So `getHeadingLevel` is
**optional** on `Collapsible` and absent means no heading element at all — the only component here where the
absence of a prop removes an element rather than defaulting one.

**The panel's role arrives as `getPanelRole` plus `getPanelAriaAttributes`, which is `Popover`'s shape**: the
role is the consumer's, so the ARIA that role requires is too, and one bag beats a prop per attribute.
`Accordion` passes `region` and an `aria-labelledby` pointing at the header id it generated, which is also why
`Collapsible` takes `getId` — whoever names the panel owns the id.

**A section has no boolean, so `SignalMirror` is the bridge.** `Accordion` owns `Signal<T[]>` and each
section reads its own membership out of it, while `Collapsible` wants the whole signal.
`SignalMirror.createValueMirror` was extracted for this and writes outward only when the value actually
differs, so "the difference is the toggle" holds and the set stays the single source of truth. Its fifth
consumer, and the first inside the library.

**`AccordionFlags` is gone rather than aliased to `CollapsibleFlags`**, following the `TextField` extraction:
old names went with it and the Playground's painter was renamed. One shape, one name.

### Controls: `Accordion`, and where auto-height measurement lives

The first component whose geometry cannot be expressed in CSS at all, which decides
the division of labour.

**The height animation is the library's, and that is not a contradiction of "a control paints nothing".**
CSS cannot transition to `auto`, so animating a panel open requires measuring the content and animating to a
pixel value. Measurement is not paint — same category as `Modal`'s alignment and `Label`'s gap — and a
painter cannot do it because the element being constrained is the library's. The painter still owns
everything visible: `renderPanel` receives `getVisibilityTarget` and `getTransitionDurationMs` in `Modal`'s
shape, so a fade or slide inside the panel is the consumer's, layered on a height the library drives.

**Three boxes, each for a reason.** The section wraps a heading and a panel; the panel carries
`overflow: hidden` and the animated height; inside it an unconstrained content div is what gets measured.
Measuring the constrained box would need the height released and restored on every pass — `TextField`'s trick
on an absolutely positioned overlay — and would fight the transition it is feeding.

**`ElementObserver.createBorderBoxHeightObserver` is the extracted half, and `TextField` was deliberately not
migrated onto it.** `backlog.md` asked for the shared piece so the measurement would not be written twice; on
reading both, they share less than that implied — `TextField` clamps to a row count derived from
`line-height`, releases `bottom` to measure a `scrollHeight`, and republishes the result as the wrapper's
`getMinHeight`. What is genuinely common is "observe an element and republish its own height", which is all
the new observer is. Its name follows the coordinate-space rule — border box, layout pixels, so `Viewport`'s
scale never enters.

**The panel stays mounted and goes `inert` rather than being unmounted or hidden.** Unmounting or
`display: none` would make the content unmeasurable and the animation impossible. `inert` takes the subtree
out of the tab order and the accessibility tree while leaving it laid out, as `Popover` does with its root.
The cost is that a collapsed panel's content is still built, so an accordion of a hundred expensive panels
builds all hundred.

**"Always exactly one open" is a second boolean, not a third state on the first one.** `isSingleExpand`
allows zero expanded — pressing the open header closes it — and `isExpandRequired` is what refuses that last
close. Two flags rather than a mode string, which is Radix's spelling of the same pair and the shape that
does not break a prop already shipped. It reads on its own terms in either mode: with single expansion it
means the only way out of a section is into another one, and with several open at once it means the last one
standing stays.

**A refused press changes nothing and says nothing.** The header is still a real button, still reports
`aria-expanded="true"`, and is not marked disabled — the same arrangement as pressing the radio that is
already selected, which is also a no-op nobody labels. Marking it disabled would make the one open section
look like the unavailable one, and the parity rule says disabled and disabled-but-reachable must look
identical.

**Headers are all in the tab order, and the arrows are an extra rather than a roving order.** The published
accordion pattern, and the opposite of `Tabs` and `RadioGroup`. The difference is what the collection means: a
tab list or radio group is one control with several states, so it gets one stop; an accordion is several
independent disclosures. Arrow, `Home` and `End` come from `NavigatorUtils.computeNextPosition` unchanged,
moving focus without selecting.

**Each header is wrapped in a real heading element, and its level is a prop.** `getHeadingLevel` defaults to
3 and picks `h1`..`h6` from a fixed list rather than building a tag name, so it stays typed. The level is
document structure, which only the consumer knows; the library owning it would either invent an outline or
force `role="heading"` with `aria-level`, and a real element is better for both AT and outline. The heading
gets `margin: 0; font: inherit` — a reset in the same category as `interactionRoot > * { margin: 0
!important }`, not paint.

**`getSizing` defaults to `"fill"`, following `Progress` rather than `InteractionWrapper`.** Found by driving
it: with the root shrink-wrapping its content, opening one section changed the widest section and re-wrapped
the text in every other one. An accordion's natural width is its container's. The type is declared on
`Accordion` rather than imported, for `Progress`'s reason.

**The header leaf must re-enable pointer events, and forgetting to is invisible to types.** The first
`Accordion.css.ts` did not, so a header looked perfect and could not be clicked — the hit test landed on the
heading above it. `Button.css.ts` and `BinarySwitch.css.ts` are the precedent. Nothing in the type system or
in a DOM assertion catches it; only a real click does.

**Scrolling a newly opened section into view is `Collapsible`'s, and it is opt-in.** `getIsScrolledIntoViewOnExpand`
defaults to off; `Accordion` passes it straight through, since the section that opened is a disclosure rather
than anything the set knows about. Off by default because the library cannot tell whether the disclosure **is**
the page — where taking the scroll position is a kindness — or one widget in a column beside other content,
where taking it steals the reader's place in something they were not touching. The consumer is the only one who
knows which, and the expensive half, knowing when the growing has stopped, stays library-side either way.
Nothing published ships it on: it is an open request against Base UI and MUI, and `backlog.md` recorded the
recipe everyone agrees on.

**It waits for the growth to finish, because the panel's size is what it has to aim at.** Scrolling when the
click lands would aim at a panel still at zero height and leave the page in the wrong place. `ElementFader`
already exposes `getHasTransitionFinished` beside its target — the completion signal `backlog.md` assumed did
not exist — so the wait is a latch armed when the section expands and read when the fader reports the
transition over. The latch is `on(..., { defer: true })`, so a section that starts life expanded does not
scroll the page as the app loads.

**Two calls, and each answers a different failure.** `scrollIntoView({ block: "nearest" })` on the whole
section brings it up by the smallest amount that shows it, and does nothing at all when it is already visible;
the same call on the **header** immediately afterwards is the clamp for a panel with more in it than the
window can hold, where reaching the panel's far edge would push the header that was just pressed off the top.
The second call gives back the least amount that puts the header back, so the panel is cut at the bottom
instead. Chromium's own reading of `"nearest"` happens to keep the header for that case already, but the
behaviour is stated rather than inherited from one engine's reading.

**And each call happens twice, once on the finish and once on the frame after it.** The fader's completion is
a timer started a frame before the CSS transition does, so it can report "over" while the last few pixels of
growth are still to paint; scrolling on that frame alone lands a few pixels short. A second pass on the next
frame corrects it. It is not a frame **instead** of the immediate call: a frame may be a long time coming on a
loaded machine, and the suite failed exactly that way while the whole of it ran at once.

### Controls: `Preview`, which shortens rather than hides

Settled with the user, for a "read more" on the Playground's card. A `Preview` shows its content down to a
height the consumer sets and opens it the rest of the way on a press.

**It is a component beside `Collapsible`, not a prop on it, because the two disagree about what collapsed
means.** MUI and Chakra took the other route — `collapsedSize` and `startingHeight` on their own `Collapse` —
and it costs them nothing because their `Collapse` is a bare transition wrapper with no `aria-expanded`, no
`aria-controls` and no `inert`. Ours has all three, and one of them **inverts**: `Collapsible` marks its panel
`inert` while closed, which is right when nothing shows and wrong here, where the opening lines are on screen
being read. A flag that silently reverses an accessibility rule is not a flag.

**Nothing is ever hidden from a screen reader, and that is a consequence rather than a choice.** `inert`
cannot be lifted off part of a text flow, so the remainder past the cut cannot be sealed without sealing the
visible opening too. The control is therefore an affordance for the eye, and a reader using a virtual cursor
gets the whole text. `preview.spec.ts` asserts it, because it is exactly the thing a later change would
"tidy up" by copying `Collapsible`.

**`getCollapsedHeight` is required, alone among the props.** There is no defensible default: the right
height depends entirely on what is being shortened, and a component that guessed would be inventing the one
number it exists to hold. `Spotlight`'s `getPadding` defaults to 0 because 0 means "no padding"; there is no
equivalent no-op height.

**Content that already fits gets no control and no overlay.** A control that opens nothing invites a press
and does not reward it. Mantine's `Spoiler` does the same — under its `maxHeight` it renders the children and
nothing else — and it is the reason the overflow test drives the paint as well as the button.

**An unmeasured content box reads as the collapsed height, never as zero.** The height observer starts at 0,
so the first render would otherwise ask for a zero-height box and then grow to the collapsed height once the
measurement arrived — a preview that visibly unfolds on page load, and a transition running before anybody
touched anything. Reading "not measured yet" as the collapsed height means the common case, where the content
overflows, never changes height at all.

**The overlay's visibility target is 1 while collapsed, which is the one place a renderer is handed the
inverse of the open state.** It is the fade that says there is more, so it belongs to the shortened state;
handing it the expanded target would mean every consumer writing the inversion themselves. The pair is
`(getVisibilityTarget, getTransitionDurationMs)` as everywhere else, and the wrapper around it is positioned
across the bottom of the clipped box — which is the library's element and unreachable from `renderContent`,
the same reason `InteractionWrapper` owns the box its `renderDecoration` paints into.

**The scroll is opt-in and fires on the way in, which is the opposite of `Accordion`'s.**
`getIsScrolledIntoViewOnCollapse`, off by default, for the user. Opening pushes what is below further
down and leaves the reader looking at the text they asked for, so nothing should move; closing pulls it all up
by the height that just vanished and takes the control they pressed with it, so something should. `Accordion`
is the mirror image — its growth is the event that can leave a section below the fold — which is why the two
props are named for the half they act on rather than sharing one name. The machinery underneath is the same,
latch and all: see _"Scrolling a newly opened section into view is `Collapsible`'s"_ for why the wait, the two
calls and the extra frame are each there.

**`Fold` is reserved and must not be spent on anything else.** The user's call, made while naming this: it is
being kept for a possible component that folds in the literal sense, growing or shrinking by 2× or 0.5×.
`Spoiler` was rejected for meaning content concealed until revealed, `Summary` because `<summary>` is the
**trigger** half of a native disclosure, and `Excerpt` because a name has to be spellable from memory.

### A SMIL animation resets by being rebuilt, and the defs record is what says so

Settled by the user, closing the `Show ... keyed` item `backlog.md` had parked. SMIL cannot be rewound in
place, so an animation restarts by being **built again** — and what rebuilds it is a new defs record: the
consumer's callback returns fresh objects, `Shape` inserts new elements, and the old ones are discarded
mid-flight. That is the whole mechanism, and it is now the stated contract rather than a side effect nobody
had written down.

**What was removed is the thing that pretended to own it.** Every animation builder wrapped its `animate`
elements in `<Show when={defs.animationIterationPatterns ?? EMPTY_ARRAY} keyed>`, whose intent was exactly
this remount. It could never fire: `defs` is a plain object, so reading a field off it tracks nothing, the
memo behind `Show` has no dependencies, and the children were built once and never again. Deleting it changed
nothing — measured, the `animate` elements are replaced on a duration change and on an iteration-pattern
change with the wrapper gone exactly as with it there. Three builders wrapped sibling elements, so a fragment
took the wrapper's place; the rest lost a level of nesting.

**An animation is started by asking for a delay from now, never by naming a moment.** `createAnimateDefs`
used to work out the document's current time and write it into `begin`; switching iteration pattern while one
was running then produced an animation that looked perfectly healthy — connected, right duration, right repeat
count, a real interval — and never animated, then reverted at the end of that interval. The instant had
already passed by the time the browser read the attribute, and an interval that begins in the past is not the
same thing as one beginning now. `beginElementAt(delay)` is the call the sequencing already used for every
later stage, so both paths now start the same way and the clock is never consulted. Measured across the
sequence that reaches it — pick a repeating pattern, let it run, switch mid-run — twenty-four runs clean where
the old path failed roughly one in three.

**The guard is a spec rather than a note**, because the failure mode is silent: memoise the defs so the same
record survives a change and the animation simply carries on with the old timing, looking like a component
that ignores its props. `shape.spec.ts` holds an element, changes the duration, and asserts the one it held is
neither the current one nor still connected.

**This is the same shape as the cell timeline being keyed on its source**, and worth reading together: in both
cases the restart is owned by an identity that changes, and in both cases the thing to avoid is a restart that
happens by accident somewhere up the tree. The difference is which document owns the clock — a `Shape` on the
page rebuilds its own elements, while a serialised source gets a new clock only by being a new image.

### The SVG defs vocabulary is sample code, and the arithmetic is a file with no JSX in it

Settled by the user, applying the `CellAnimation` ownership rule to the one place it had not reached.

**The library never used any of it.** Seven named tilings, four families of animation builder, and the shared
helpers under them were exported from `components/src` and called by nothing except Playground samples. `Shape`
takes `computeFillDefs` and `computeStrokeDefs` from its consumer and renders whatever it is handed, which is
the same seam `CellAnimation` has for weights — so a named set of tilings is vocabulary, and vocabulary
belongs where the origins and the weights already went.

**What moved and what stayed.** The seven tilings and the `Linear` / `Radial` / `Path` / `Gradient` builders
are now `Samples/SVGDefs`. `computePattern` — place N cells in a tile and repeat it — stays, along with
`createAnimateDefs` and `unrollSelfReferencingPatterns`, because those are what a consumer writing a tiling of
their own would build on. The gradient file stays whole.

**The split the move was for is a file extension.** `vitest` runs `src/**/*.test.ts` in a node environment
with no JSX transform, which is the rule _"Unit tests"_ in `conventions.md` already states — so a test cannot import a file
containing an element. That makes the separation mandatory rather than stylistic: `SVGPatternLayouts.const.ts`
and `SVGAnimationTracks.const.ts` hold the arithmetic and no markup, `SVGPatterns.const.tsx` and
`SVGAnimations.const.tsx` hold the builders that consume them. This is what `backlog.md` asked for and could
not get while the numbers lived inside the callback that emitted the element.

**A tiling is now four pure functions rather than a closure.** Each entry in `SVGPatternLayouts.ALL` answers
how many cells the requested count rounds to, how big one tile is, where a cell sits, and whether it straddles
the seam. A wrong tiling still tiles — that is the whole reason this arithmetic could be wrong for months —
and now the pointy-top hexagon's rows can be asserted to sit at −15, 7.5 and 30 for a 30px cell, which is the
three-quarter overlap that makes hexagons interlock rather than merely repeat.

**One thing the extraction found immediately.** `computeGrowTracks` assumes its two ends are given in order;
handed them reversed it walks outside the segment instead of mirroring. No call site does that, so it is a
precondition rather than a defect, and it is pinned by a test rather than changed — the behaviour is what
ships and nothing has asked for the other one.

### `LiveAnnouncer`: the region that belongs to no component

Settled, on the user's call, for `Calendar`'s month change.

**A live region only announces content inserted after it is already in the document** — the rule `Toasts`
records — which is why a component cannot mount one when it needs to speak. Two module-level regions, polite
and assertive, created on first use and kept, sidestep that. They live on `document.body` rather than in the
`Viewport` portal: nothing about them is painted, so the scale factor is irrelevant, and they must outlive any
subtree that might announce through them.

**A region can be reserved before there is anything to say.** `reserve(politeness)` creates one without
announcing, for a consumer that knows it will speak later and cannot afford the first message to be the one
that creates the region — `Toasts` calls it for both politeness levels when its stack mounts. Nothing else
needs it: a `Calendar` cannot announce a month change until someone has already paged it, by which time the
region has existed for as long as the page.

**Each message is its own node, removed a second later.** Setting the text of one persistent node does not
re-announce an identical string, so paging back to a month you were just on would be silent. Appending a fresh
child is an addition every time, which is what `aria-relevant="additions"` tells a reader to watch. Radix's
per-toast announce arrangement and React Aria's shared announcer, from the same constraint.

**Visually hidden by the clip-rect idiom, not `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`**, either of which
would take the text out of the accessibility tree along with the paint. The styles are applied imperatively
because the element is the library's own and never reaches a stylesheet.

**`Calendar` is the first consumer, and it formats the month itself.** Paging swaps all 42 cells and changes
nothing else, so a screen reader user hears nothing until they move focus. The month title on the page is the
consumer's markup — `Calendar` renders no header — so the announcement cannot be read off it and goes through
the same `Intl` path the day labels use. Politely, because paging is something the reader just did rather
than news. The previous month arrives as the effect's own argument, so the first run has nothing to compare
against and a calendar never talks about itself as it mounts.

### `NavigatorUtils.computeNextCell`: the two-axis walk never wraps and never clamps

Settled, beside the 1D walk rather than replacing it, and deliberately different at the edges.

`computeNextPosition` wraps within its length, because a tab list or menu is a closed ring.
`computeNextCell` does neither: overflow along a row **carries** into the neighbouring row, and `y` is
allowed out of range. That lets a caller whose grid is a window onto something larger resolve the overflow by
moving the window — `Calendar` reads `y === -1` as "the previous month" and needs no special case for the
first or last day. `x` is always in range, because carrying is what puts it there.

**Page keys mean a page of rows, and a caller for whom they mean something else turns them off.** A month is
not six weeks, so `Calendar` passes `hasPageKeys: false` and does month arithmetic itself. `hasEdgeKeys`
works as before, and `Home` / `End` are the ends of the **row**, not of the grid.

### Controls: `RangeCalendar`, `DateRangePicker`, and the half-entered state

**`RangeCalendar` is a second component beside `Calendar`, not a mode on it**, on the precedent `MultiSelect`
already set: the shared work moved into a `CalendarComposite` — the grid, the roving day, the keyboard, the
month announcement — and the two thin components over it own only their value shape and answer three hooks,
`computeIsSelected`, `computeAnchorDay` and `onPick`. `SelectComposite` is the same arrangement, so a reader
who knows one knows both. `DateRangePicker` sits beside `DatePicker` the same way.

**The half-entered state is the component's, and never reaches the consumer.** `RangeCalendar` holds the first
end in a private signal; while it is set, the outward value is `undefined` and the grid paints the span from
that end to the roving day, so keyboard movement previews the range without a pointer. The second press
commits `orderRange(first, second)`, which sorts the ends — so picking backwards gives the same span, and a
consumer never receives a record of which end was clicked first. A third press starts again rather than
extending, which is the behaviour that needs no rule to remember.

**Three flags carry the band: `isInRange`, `isRangeStart`, `isRangeEnd`.** `isInRange` is inclusive of both
ends, so a painter can lay a continuous band and then round the two caps; the ends are marked separately
rather than inferred from position, because the first and last day of a visible week are not the ends of the
span. The Playground's day painter writes them out as `data-in-range`, `data-range-start` and `data-range-end`
so the suite can read the flag rather than a hashed class or a computed colour.

**`DateRangePicker` derives its two fields from the one signal.** A start typed on its own leaves the outward
value `undefined`, exactly as a single press on the calendar does, and the grid and the fields are two ways
into the same value rather than two values kept in step.

### A typed sign is opt-in, and only the grouped mask has one

**`TextSyncGroupDefs` gained `hasSign`, and nothing else can hold a sign.** `applyGroupedMask` takes a minus
wherever it appears in the text, moves it to the front, and keeps it while the digits regroup; `applyMask`, the
fixed-pattern one, has no notion of it. That asymmetry is the point rather than an omission: a date's ISO
spelling is `2026-08-10`, so a fixed-pattern field that read a hyphen as a sign would misread every date it
was given. The flag is off by default, so an unsigned field drops a typed minus rather than refusing the
keystroke — the digits still land, which is what a consumer who did not ask for signed amounts wants.

**A lone minus is held rather than dropped**, because otherwise the sign could never be typed before the
digits, which is the order everybody types it in. The mask returns the sign alone with the caret behind it,
and `MaskedField` reports no value until digits arrive — a sign is not an amount.

**The sign rides in the digit string, and `MaskedField` gained one optional def to allow it.** `readDigits`
overrides how the field reads digits out of its text, defaulting to `TextSyncUtils.getMaskedDigits`, which
strips everything that is not a digit. `CurrencyInput` passes `readSignedDigits` when signed, so `fromDigits`
receives `"-123456"` and `toDigits` returns it. Widening the shared digit reader instead was rejected for the
same reason the mask flag exists: `DateInput` would have started reading its ISO separators as signs.

**`DecimalUtils.toDigits` drops the sign**, which is documented in `ss-utils` and is correct there — it
converts a magnitude. `CurrencyInput` re-attaches the sign around it rather than asking that utility to
change, because the sign belongs to the field's spelling and not to the decimal shift.

### Group sizes are read from the decimal point outwards, and the last one repeats

**`TextSyncGroupDefs.groupSizes` is a list, read from the point outwards.** `[3]` is every locale that groups
in threes, `[4]` is a group of four, and `[3, 2]` is the Indian grouping: three digits nearest the point, then
twos for as long as the digits last. The last entry repeating is what lets a fixed-length list describe a
number of any size — the alternative, a list as long as the value has groups, would have to be recomputed
every keystroke by whoever supplied it.

**An empty list means no grouping at all**, which is the same rule read at its limit: there is no size to
repeat, so the whole run is one group. A size below one is treated the same way, because the alternative is a
loop that never advances.

**`getGroupSizes` reads the pattern off `Intl` rather than carrying a table of locales.** It formats a
ten-digit sample, measures each group the locale produced, reverses them and drops the leading one — which is
a remainder rather than a group — then collapses the repeated tail to a single entry. Ten digits is chosen
because it divides evenly by none of the group sizes in use, so the leftmost part is always a partial group
and dropping it is always safe. A locale that produced no groups at all falls back to threes, matching what
`DecimalUtils.getSeparators` does when a locale names no separator.

### `DateTimeValue`, and why a missing half is no value

**`DateTimeValue` is `{ date: DateValue; time: TimeValue }` in `Abstracts`**, joining the calendar-aware date
this library owns to the `TimeValue` from `ss-utils`. `DateTimeValueUtils` covers the operations the two
halves cannot answer between them — `isSame` ignores the seconds shape the way `TimeUtils` does, `compare`
orders by date and falls back to time, and `toDate` flattens to a real `Date`.

**`createSplit` is the composition, and `DateTimePicker` is the control over it.** The helper takes the one
signal and returns a date signal and a time signal for the existing fields; the control pairs `DatePicker`
with `TimePicker` over them, so the consumer holds one value and the two fields are an implementation detail.
The helper is exported in its own right, because pairing a plain `DateInput` with a `TimeInput` needs the
split without the two popups.

**The control passes its shared props to both halves and overrides what cannot be shared.** The props type is
`Omit<DatePickerProps, "valueSignal" | "ariaLabel" | "visibilitySignal">` plus the time-only knobs, so the
field paint, the layer placement and the locale are written once. Three things collide and are named apart:
`renderTimeTrailing`, `renderTimePopup`, and the two visibility signals. One collides silently and is
overridden — `renderLeading` on the date side takes an era as its second argument, which the time field has
no notion of, so the time half is given `undefined` rather than the date half's renderer.

**Both composed pickers set `width: fit-content` and stop their children shrinking.** Without it the two
picker roots are flex items that shrink below their content and overlap, which puts the second field's trigger
underneath the first field's input — clickable by coordinate, unclickable by pointer. `DateRangePicker` has the
same rule for the same reason. The Playground pages give these examples `span: 2`, because a control about
460px wide otherwise overflows a 320px grid column and the neighbouring card paints over its trigger.

**A pair with a half missing reports nothing, and this was corrected mid-build.** The first version filled the
absent half from a default, so typing a date alone produced a value at midnight. That is wrong twice over: it
disagrees with `RangeCalendar`, where half a range is explicitly not a range, and it made editing destructive,
because clearing a field to retype it dropped the other half. The split now remembers each half privately and
emits only when both are present — so clearing one clears the value, and retyping it brings the other back.

### Controls: `Calendar`, and the date value the library owns

Settled, closing the dependency question `backlog.md` recorded as a real decision.

**No date library, and no `Date` in the public API.** `Abstracts/DateValue` holds
`DateValue = { year, month, day }` with **`month` 1-12**, plus `DateValueUtils`. Two things drove it: a
`Date` is an instant, so a date-only value round-tripping through one shifts across a zone boundary, while a
record has nothing to shift by; and `Intl.DateTimeFormat` already supplies every locale-dependent string, so
the only thing left to own is arithmetic, about eighty lines. Months are 1-12 rather than `Date`'s 0-11
because an off-by-one month is the most common bug in date code and no type catches it.

**Every conversion goes through midday**, never midnight. A midnight anchor can land on the hour a zone skips
or repeats, so "add a day" moves by 23 or 25 hours and lands on the same or the wrong calendar date — a
stepper that appears to stick. Midday is never inside a transition anywhere on Earth.
`DateValue.utils.test.ts` pins both European transition dates.

**No conversion may pass a year to the `Date` constructor, because it reads 0 to 99 as the 1900s.** Corrected
. `new Date(year, month - 1, day, 12)` was the single conversion for a long time and is wrong
below year 100: a Caesar born in year 44 was stored as 44 and described everywhere as 1944 — wrong weekday,
wrong grid, wrong label — with nothing reporting a problem. `getDaysInMonth` had it twice over: February in
year 4 answered 29 because it was really being asked about 1904.

Both now go through one private `buildLocalDate`, which builds an anchor date in a safe year and calls
`setFullYear(year, month, day)` — the documented way past the shorthand. **All three fields go in that one
call**: set alone, the year lands on an anchor whose month and day have already been normalised, and year 0 is
a leap year while the 1900 it was shorthand for is not, so 29 February in year 0 would have become 1 March on
the way through. The shorthand is unreachable from the rest of the file — the two remaining `new Date` calls
with a literal year build the month and weekday **name** lists, where the year is an arbitrary anchor.

**A year outside 0000 to 9999 is written in ISO 8601's expanded form, and only then.** Same day, closing the
other half of the same bug. `toIso` was padding the _signed_ string, so year −44 came out as `0-44-08-01` with
the minus where the third digit belongs, and `fromIso`'s four-digit pattern refused to read it back. Padding
the absolute value and putting the sign in front is the whole fix; the pattern widens to "four bare digits, or
a sign and six" and the fixed length check goes, since a pattern anchored at both ends already rejects
anything longer. Six digits with a leading sign is what ISO 8601 prescribes and what
`Date.prototype.toISOString` emits, so the expanded form round-trips through the platform.

**Expanded only when the year needs it.** Emitting a sign on every date would be more uniform and would
rewrite every stored date string every consumer has, for a case almost nobody reaches. The cost is that the
writer is canonical while the reader is lenient — `fromIso` accepts `+002026-08-10` and `toIso` gives back
`2026-08-10` — so reading and writing normalises rather than reproducing the input character for character.
Both halves are pinned by tests. `-000000` is refused: ISO 8601 does not allow a negative zero year, and
`toIso` can never emit one.

**What this does not buy: a BC date still cannot be typed.** `DateInput`'s mask is a fixed run of digit slots
and everything that is not a digit is discarded on the way in, so a sign has nowhere to go — the same missing
piece `backlog.md` tracks for the formatted number. Storing, loading, computing and displaying a
pre-common-era date all work; entering one is by code or by the calendar's paging.

Before anything labels one: this is astronomical year numbering, inherited from `Date`, so there is a year 0
and it is 1 BC — year −44 is 45 BC. `Intl`'s `era` option already does that conversion, and nothing here
should reimplement it.

**`addMonths` clamps the day; `fromIso` refuses an impossible date.** 31 January plus a month is 28 or 29
February, never 2 or 3 March, because `Date.setMonth`'s rollover makes a month stepper skip months. And
`fromIso("2026-02-31")` is `undefined` rather than 3 March: a field that silently moves what was typed is
worse than one reporting the value as not yet valid.

**The grid is always six weeks of seven days, and carries the neighbouring months' days.** A fixed row count
stops the calendar changing height as months are paged. The neighbouring days make the keyboard walk work
without a special case — the grid is a continuous run of dates, so the next cell from `computeNextCell` maps
back as `addDays(gridStart, y * 7 + x)` whatever `y` is.

**The page keys move a month, and held Shift moves a year.** `PageUp` and `PageDown` step the roving day by
one month, `Shift` with either steps it by one year, and both go through the same `moveTo` — so both clamp to
`min` and `max`, both pull the visible month along, and both are announced by the month effect already
watching it. This is the one part of the grid's keyboard a consumer cannot supply from outside: the grid owns
its `keydown` handler, so a caption can offer a year jump as a button but nothing outside can bind a key to
one. Note that the year step is `addYears` rather than twelve `addMonths`, which is what keeps 29 February on
a year that has no 29 February from walking somewhere unexpected.

**Forty-two `InteractionWrapper`s per month is the cost of consistency, and it has been measured rather than
worried about.** Building a whole calendar — which is what opening a `DatePicker` popup does — takes about
3ms of work, and changing month takes about 1.7ms, worst case under 3ms; both are the synchronous update, so
the frame they land in is not otherwise at risk. That is a headless Chromium on one machine over a production
build rather than a guarantee, but it settles the shape of the answer: a three-month view would be roughly
9ms to build and 5ms to page, still inside a frame, and the per-cell wrapper is not what would make a
multi-month calendar expensive. The remaining per-cell cost worth caring about is a consumer's own disabled
predicate, which is called once per cell and is theirs to make cheap.

**The visible month is a `Signal` the consumer owns, and `Calendar` renders no header.** `monthSignal` is
required, and the month title and paging buttons are the consumer's markup outside the component. The
alternative — a private month plus a `renderHeader` slot handed paging callbacks — would invent a controller
record for something the settled convention covers. `Calendar` writes the signal when the keyboard walk leaves
the month, which is exactly the two-way case, and it means `DatePicker` can snap the month to the value when
its popup opens without the component having an opinion.

**That header being the consumer's is what made an interactive caption free.** Added: the
Playground's caption is a month title that turns into a `Select` for the month and a `NumberInput` for the
year when clicked, with the paging arrows either side throughout. `Calendar` was not touched — the caption
writes `monthSignal` exactly as the arrows did. It lives in `StyledComponents/CalendarCaption` and both
`CalendarPage` and `DatePickerPage` use it, since the two had written the same header twice.

**The fields are a mode, not the resting state**, so a calendar reads as a calendar until someone asks to
jump. Three things end the mode and they are not interchangeable: `Enter` accepts and hands focus back to the
title; `Escape` puts the month back to what it was when the mode opened, which is the only reason a restore
point is kept; and focus leaving the group ends it without moving focus, since the usual way out is clicking a
day and pulling focus off that day would undo the click.

`Escape` layers correctly with the month `Select` underneath — `Select` handles the key only while its popup
is open and marks the event handled, so the first press closes the popup and the second closes the mode; the
caption checks that flag rather than the key alone. The cost: `Enter` cannot close the mode from the month
field, because `Select` claims `Enter` unconditionally. From the year field it works, and `Escape` and `Tab`
work from either.

**Two bugs found building it, both recurring in any component with modes.** A `focusout` fires when the
fields unmount, _after_ the mode has been ended by `Enter` or `Escape`, so the focus-out handler ran a second
time and cancelled the focus restore the first exit asked for; it now ignores anything arriving once the mode
is closed. And the year field's `SignalMirror` pushes its inner value outward from an effect, which runs after
the handler that closed the mode — so `Escape` restored the old month and the mirror wrote the abandoned one
back over it; the year write ignores anything queued while the mode is closed. Both are the same shape:
**ending a mode is not one event, and the tail of the old mode arrives after it.**

**The year is written on a `FunctionUtils.debounce`, not on every keystroke.** Typing 1066 into a live field
pages the calendar through years 1, 10 and 106. `Enter` and focus-out flush whatever is pending rather than
waiting, so nothing is lost by leaving quickly. The mirror tolerates this without special handling — while no
write has landed the outer value has not changed, so nothing pushes back over what is being typed.

**The year is a number field rather than a second `Select`, and not on taste.** A `Select` materialises every
option and nothing here virtualises them, so a year list must be bounded — and any bound is invented, since a
hundred years back is right for a birthday and absurd for a booking. A number field needs no bound, and typing
four digits beats scrolling eighty rows even in the ordinary case.

**The caption sets the calendar's width, which is why the day cell grew from 36px to 46px.** Two arrow
buttons, a month name and a four-digit year do not fit across seven 36px columns — the frame ended up a
hundred pixels wider than the grid, with the grid visibly floating. `Calendar`'s root is `width: fit-content`
and the cell size is the Playground painter's, so the cell is the only end that can move: 46px × 7 is 322px,
which is what the caption needs. If a `getSizing` is ever added to `Calendar`, this constraint goes away.

It also keeps the frame still across the mode switch: the edit-mode header is the wider of the two, so sizing
the grid to it means the box does not resize under the pointer when the title is clicked — which it would
have, by seventy pixels, at the old cell size.

**Selection is by date, one tab stop, and the cell carries the whole date as its name.** `valueSignal` holds a
`DateValue | undefined`. The grid is a roving tab order over 42 `InteractionWrapper`s, following `Tabs` rather
than `Select`'s `aria-activedescendant`, because each day is a real element that can hold focus. Since the
painter draws a bare number, the cell sets `aria-label` to the full formatted date, or a reader announces
"17" with no month. `aria-current="date"` marks today, `aria-selected` the selection.

**`CalendarFlags` carries the day itself**, unlike every other flags record, because the painter's whole job
is to draw that date and it would otherwise be handed the accessor twice — once as `renderDay`'s first
argument and once inside the flags. Both are available, and the flag is the one a `classList` block can read
alongside `isSelected` and `isOutsideMonth`.

**An intervening wrapper div sits between `role="row"` and `role="gridcell"`**, because every cell is an
`InteractionWrapper` owning its own root. `Select` already made this trade between `role="listbox"` and
`role="option"`; it is in `backlog.md` now that a second component has hit it, a grid's row/cell relationship
being the stricter of the two.

### Pointer drag: a ratio, opt-in, and captured

Settled, closing the primitive `backlog.md` #2 asked for.
`InteractionTracker.trackDrag(ref, disabled, opts)` reports where a pointer is inside an element for as long as
a drag lasts.

**It is a separate call rather than part of `wrapElement`**, as item 1 asked: most controls want no listener
at all, and a two-dimensional surface is the one shape that cannot borrow a native input the way `Range`
borrows one per thumb.

**It reports a ratio of the element's own box, not a position**, which keeps it out of the coordinate-space
trap: pointer coordinates and the element's rect are both client-space, so `Viewport`'s scale divides out of
the fraction exactly and never has to be looked up. Same insight that fixed the two geometry specs — a ratio
of two same-space measurements is scale-free by construction.

**`setPointerCapture` is load-bearing.** A drag that stops reporting when the pointer leaves the element
strands the control mid-drag, and releasing outside must still land the value. Capture also means the
`pointermove` handler can be on the element rather than the document, so nothing leaks when the component goes
away.

**`pointerdown` reports immediately**, so a click positions the value without a drag — what a colour surface
and any track-clicking slider need.

### The swipe: one gesture over the drag machinery, an axis it claims, and a verdict at the end

Settled, closing the gesture `Abstract` `backlog.md` #26 asked for. `InteractionTracker.trackSwipe(ref,
disabled, opts)` reports how far a pointer has pushed an element along one axis, and at the release says
whether that push counts. `Drawer` and `Carousel` are its two consumers.

**Both gestures sit on one private `trackPointer`, and the public pair stay separate.** `trackPointer` owns
the pointer bookkeeping — which pointer is being followed, capture, the four listeners, and whether a release
was a release or a cancel. `trackDrag` reports position from it and `trackSwipe` reports travel from it, and
neither has a way to express the other's report. The item argued for exactly this: a drag reports **state**
for as long as it lasts, a swipe reports **an event** with a verdict, and the argument survived the later
decision that a swipe also reports progress in flight, because the verdict is still a thing a drag has no
word for.

**`trackDrag` now says why a drag ended, which closes `SlideButton`'s cancelled-pointer gap in the same
change.** `onDragEnd` receives `"release"` or `"cancel"`; `SlideButton` activates only on the first, so a
drag the browser or the OS takes over with the thumb already at the end no longer confirms. A swipe must
never commit on a cancel, and that consumer is what made the change to a shipped `Abstract` worth making —
recorded in the item as the condition for doing it.

**Travel is a ratio of the element's own box, not a distance in pixels.** Same insight as `trackDrag`'s:
pointer coordinates and the element's rect are both client-space, so a `Viewport` scale divides out of the
fraction exactly. It also answers the question the item left open — whether in-flight progress should be a
raw offset or a ratio — without taking either horn. A ratio **of the commit threshold** would mean the
`Abstract` dividing by a number only the consumer knows, which is why the item leaned towards the offset; a
ratio **of the element** is neither, and it is the space `trackDrag` already reports in. A consumer wanting
the fraction-of-threshold reading divides at the call site, where the threshold lives.

**The box is the one the gesture started in, and this is load-bearing rather than tidy.** A drawer that
follows the finger moves the very element the ratio is measured against, so a live `getBoundingClientRect`
feeds the element's own displacement back into the travel: pushing a left-edge drawer leftwards halves every
reading, and pushing a right-edge one rightwards runs away to a commit on the first move. Freezing the rect
at `pointerdown` removes the loop. `trackDrag` keeps measuring live, because its two consumers do not move
under the pointer and a page scrolling during a drag would strand a frozen rect.

**A swipe takes the pointer over only once it has travelled, and a drag takes it immediately.** `trackDrag`
captures and calls `preventDefault` on `pointerdown`, which is right for a colour surface — a click there
sets a value. A swipe cannot: the elements it watches are a dialog and a carousel viewport, both full of
buttons and links, and capturing every press inside them would break all of them. So `trackSwipe` waits until
the travel passes a small slop, then captures, and swallows the one `click` that follows an engaged gesture
so a swipe that began over a button does not also press it. The slop is a ratio of the element like everything
else here, which does mean a wide carousel tolerates more jitter than a narrow drawer; a constant in pixels
would be the truer reading of finger jitter, and was not worth reintroducing the scale question for.

**The `Abstract` writes `touch-action` itself, from the axis it was given.** A horizontal swipe sets `pan-y`
and a vertical one `pan-x`, so the browser keeps the axis the gesture does not want and the page still
scrolls. Leaving this to the consumer's stylesheet is the silent-failure case the item warned about: get it
wrong and the browser claims the gesture, the handler never fires, and it happens only on touch hardware.
Since the axis and the CSS have to agree, the `Abstract` owns both ends rather than documenting the pairing.

**`Modal` moves the container, and no painter had to change.** The swipe offset is a `transform` on
`modalContainer` while the painter keeps its own slide off `getVisibilityTarget` — two elements, two
transforms, composing. This follows the rule already recorded for the edges: **placement is geometry and the
slide is paint**, and where the dialog box sits is placement. It also means every existing `Modal` consumer
gets the gesture without touching `renderContent`, which a third argument handing out the offset would not
have.

**A committed swipe keeps its offset and lets the exit run from there.** Resetting the transform on commit
would snap the panel back to fully open for one frame before the painter slid it out. The offset is cleared
when the fader stops being visible, which is after the exit has finished and the whole layer has unmounted.

**Where the gesture is offered is derived, never configured — SC 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures, Level A.** A swipe
is path-based, so anything operable by one must also be operable with a single pointer and no path. `Modal`
attaches it only when the alignment is an edge, and only when overlay-click dismissal is still on: `Escape`
is the path-free route, and a consumer who has already turned off casual dismissal is not handed a more
casual one. `Carousel` attaches it only when `renderControls` was passed, since a carousel without controls
has no keyboard route at all — the same shape as the floater observers running only when `renderFloater` is
passed. A consumer cannot ask for the conformance failure because there is no prop with which to ask.

**A swiping carousel does not rotate, for the same reason a hovered one does not.** WCAG 2.2.2 asks that
self-moving content not move under the pointer; a finger on the track is a pointer on it. `getIsHeld` keeps
its recorded meaning — hovered, focus within, page hidden — and the swipe joins the rotation predicate beside
it rather than being folded into the flag the consumer reads.

**The commit thresholds are per component, not one constant here.** `trackSwipe` takes `getCommitRatio` and
has no default; `Modal` and `Carousel` each name their own. The item recorded that shape, and it is the same
rule as merging two implementations that disagree on a constant. Neither number is a public prop, for the
reason `SlideButton` has no threshold prop: a tuned value with no consumer behind it is a guess.

**A threshold is a fraction of the drawer, so the four edges commit at the same fraction and different
distances.** The travel is measured against the dialog box along the swipe axis, and how thick a drawer is
belongs to the painter — on the Playground a side drawer is 320px wide and a sheet 400px deep, so the same
0.35 asks for 112px sideways and 140px vertically. The alternative readings are a fraction of the viewport,
which would make a narrow drawer need a push most of the way across the screen, and a distance in pixels,
which would make a thin drawer commit almost at once and a thick one feel stuck. Proportional to the thing
being pushed is the reading that holds at every size, and it is the one a person's hand is already using —
the drawer under the finger is the whole of what they can see moving.

**A sheet whose content scrolls needs a second mechanism, and `touch-action` alone cannot be it.** The first
build left top and bottom edges out on the reasoning that `touch-action: pan-x` on the dialog would disable
touch scrolling inside it. That reasoning was wrong in both directions, and the correction is the useful part.

`touch-action` is **not** simply inherited down the tree. A gesture resolves it by walking from the touched
element up to the nearest ancestor that would handle the gesture — the first containing scroll container —
and intersecting only that stretch. Anything above that scroller is never consulted. So `pan-x` on the dialog
does not reach a scrolling panel inside it, and the panel keeps scrolling normally. What actually happens is
the reverse of the fear: over a scrolling panel the browser takes the vertical gesture and the swipe never
fires, and over a panel that does not scroll the swipe works. A gesture that silently works in some places
and not others is worse than one that does not exist, which is why the limit was worth removing rather than
documenting.

**So the gesture is claimed on the first touch move, and held for the whole gesture.** `trackSwipe` listens
to `touchmove` non-passively and, on the first move that has a direction, walks the scroll chain from the
touch target up to the tracked element asking whether anything there could still scroll the way the finger is
pushing. If something can, the gesture is the browser's and the swipe stays out of it; if nothing can — the
sheet is at the top of its content and the finger is pushing down — `preventDefault` claims it. This is the
iOS sheet rule: reading scrolls, and pushing from the top dismisses.

**Holding it for the whole gesture is the part that is easy to get wrong.** Preventing only the first move
stops that one scroll, and then the browser claims the _next_ move and sends `pointercancel` — the pointer
stream ends mid-swipe and nothing commits. Measured in Chromium: preventing every move keeps `pointermove`
flowing to the end with no cancel and no scrolling; preventing none scrolls and cancels at the second move;
preventing only the first scrolls nothing but still cancels. So the decision is taken once per gesture and
then applied to every move of it.

**`touch-action` still carries the axis, because it is the up-front declaration.** It is what tells the
browser the intent before any listener runs, and it is what keeps the page from panning across a drawer in
the areas that have no scroller of their own. The `touchmove` guard is the second half, not a replacement.

**This is the only place in the library that listens to touch events rather than pointer events.** Pointer
events cannot express it: by the time `pointercancel` arrives the browser has already taken the gesture, and
there is no pointer-level way to say "not this one". The guard is therefore touch-only and the mouse path
never reaches it.

### Controls: `ColorArea`, and the value form a picker has to hold

The saturation-and-brightness surface replacing the OS colour dialog, plus the
arithmetic under it.

**Hex is the storage form and HSV the working one, and they do not round-trip.** `Abstracts/ColorValue` holds
both plus the conversions. Eight bits per channel cannot carry hue at black or saturation at grey, so a
surface re-reading the hex on every drag frame would drift and then stick — drag brightness to zero and the
hue is gone. `ColorArea` takes `hsvSignal: Signal<ColorValueHsv>` and never touches hex; converting at the
boundary is the consumer's, and `ColorValueUtils.getIsSameHex` exists so a caller can tell whether the hex it
was handed still describes the HSV it holds. Same shape as the timezone decision under `Calendar`: keep the
lossless form in the working state, convert only at the edges.

**The surface is a `role="group"` over two real range inputs, one per axis.** Both collapsed to a pixel and
taken out of hit-testing, so the drag on the group owns the pointer while the keyboard and assistive
technology get the native slider free — arrow keys, `aria-valuetext`, the lot. Collapsed rather than
`display: none`, because a hidden element is not focusable and the tab order is the point of them. A single
`role="slider"` element was rejected: one slider cannot honestly carry two values, and it would mean
reimplementing key handling two native inputs already have.

Accepted cost: the axis inputs' own focus rings are invisible, so the painter draws focus from `focusedAxis`
in the flags — the arrangement `TextInput` uses for its caret colour rather than the rejected
`:has(:focus-visible)` shape, because here the flag reaches the painter directly.

**`syncElement` returns for a fourth time.** Both axis inputs are pushed from state in a render effect, for
`BinarySwitch`'s reason: the browser moves a range input before it reports, so an owner that refuses or snaps
the write would leave the element holding a value state does not agree with.

**`PopoverRole` gained `"dialog"`.** `Select` brought `listbox` and `Menu` brought `menu`; a popup holding a
control surface rather than a list of choices is a dialog. The union grows as consumers arrive rather than
being a general string.

**`ColorInput` **is** the picker now, and the OS dialog is gone.** It was a native
`<input type="color">` behind a painter; it is now a field button plus a `Popover` with `ColorArea` and a hue
`Range` inside. The three open ownership questions:

- **The hex boundary is the component's.** `valueSignal` stays `Signal<string>`, so no consumer changed, and
  the HSV working state lives inside where a drag cannot lose hue at black. Both directions of that sync
  guard with `getIsSameHex` and read the far side `untrack`ed — a mirror that tracks both sides writes its
  stale half over the new value. The emitted spelling is six digits while alpha is 1 and eight when it is
  not, so the old contract is unchanged until a consumer uses opacity.
- **Dismissal is the component's, and it needs a document listener.** `Select` closes on blur because its
  popup refuses focus; a colour popup cannot, since the axis sliders and the hue slider must be focusable. So
  `ColorInput` listens for a `pointerdown` outside both popup and field while open, and `Escape` closes from
  either and returns focus to the field. The first popup here needing outside-click detection, and why
  `Popover` still has none — the need is the consumer's, not the layer's.
- **The paint is four slots**, following `Select`'s count: `renderContent` for the field, `renderArea` and
  `renderHue` for the two controls, and `renderPopup` for everything around them. `renderPopup` receives a
  thunk rendering the surface plus the HSV signal itself, which lets a consumer add a colour-space toggle and
  channel inputs — paint and arithmetic over a value they now hold, not behaviour the library owes them.

**There is no `renderAlpha`, and there will not be one — settled by the user.** Alpha is a
channel input in `renderPopup`. It was argued the other way first, on the grounds that alpha is judged by eye
and a number field makes you type-look-type; what defeated that is `NumberInput`'s press-and-hold, which
repeats while the stepper is held, so the field already gives continuous adjustment against a live preview. A
fourth slot would have bought the checkerboard track and nothing else, at the price of a permanent optional
prop and a mode on a shipped control.

The omission reads as a gap from outside: `renderArea` and `renderHue` are library-owned inputs and alpha has
no twin, so a consumer scanning the props concludes transparency is unsupported. It is not — the value is
`HSVA` throughout and `toHexValue` emits eight digits whenever alpha is below opaque. The two slots exist
because those controls own a **gesture** the library implements, and alpha owns none.

**A native colour input is no longer reachable through this control**, which is the cost: no form value and
no OS picker, and `FileInput` remains the only control where the UA owns activation. The suite got better for
it — every part of the picker is drivable, where the OS dialog could only be tested by writing the value.

**`Popover` refuses `mousedown` for a list, not for a dialog.** The `preventDefault` that makes `Select` work
also cancels the default action of pressing a native control, and a range thumb's drag **is** that default
action. So a `dialog` popover holding real controls skips it: the hue slider could be typed into but not
dragged, and nothing in the DOM showed it. The role already states the intent, so this is a branch on
`getRole()` rather than a new prop.

**Alpha is optional on the working form, and 0-1 everywhere except in a hex string.** `ColorValueHsv` gained
`a?: number`, so `ColorArea` passes it through untouched and an absent alpha means opaque. `toHexa` always
emits eight digits, because a form that only sometimes carries alpha is a form you cannot type into. `hsl` is
a display form only.

**A two-way mirror must track only its own source, and this cost two bugs to learn.** The Playground's picker
mirrors the hue into a `Signal<number>` for the slider, and both directions originally read the other side's
value inside the effect. That makes the pair fight: picking a colour elsewhere re-ran the hue-to-picker
direction, which found the hue signal still holding the previous hue and wrote that stale hue over the new
colour — so typing a hex produced a different colour entirely. The guard on the far side has to be read
`untrack`ed. The same shape broke the hex field twice over: an effect refreshing the field's text while
tracking the picker overwrote what was being typed. The fourth mirror in the Playground and the first two to
go wrong, which is the argument for extracting it.

**A hex field owns its text until it is left.** Three and four digit hex forms parse, so a half-typed value
commits early; pushing the canonical spelling back in would replace the text under the caret and send the rest
of the keystrokes into the middle of it. Refreshing on the way out is `NumberInput`'s clamp-on-blur rule
applied to a different kind of incompleteness.

**`PageTextField` cannot be used for a field whose value is derived.** Its internal mirror lands one tick
behind the element, and `TextSync` then restores the caret to the offsets captured before the write, so every
character after the first is inserted one position early. The picker's hex field uses `TextInput` directly
with a signal it owns. Worth recording because the wrapper is used on nine other pages and works fine — the
difference is only that their values are not converted on the way through.

### Controls: `DateInput` and `DatePicker`, without the mask

Both ship; the mask `backlog.md` named as their blocker turned out not to be one for
a typed date.

**`DateInput` is a `TextField` over a private text signal, and it reads and writes ISO order only.**
`yyyy-mm-dd`, because that is the one spelling `DateValueUtils.fromIso` accepts and refuses exactly — it
returns nothing for 31 February rather than nudging it into March. A locale-ordered display (`dd/mm/yyyy`) is
what actually needs the mask, since the caret has to skip separators and the display form stops matching the
value form.

**The field owns its text while it is being typed, and snaps when it is left.** The rule the hex field arrived
at, for the same reason: a partial value is not a value, so a string shorter than a complete date is ignored
rather than treated as cleared, and the canonical spelling is written back on blur. This is why `DateInput`
sits on `TextField` rather than `TextInput` — `TextFieldPresetProps` omits `onBlur`, and the blur is the whole
mechanism.

**Its two range props are `getMinDate` / `getMaxDate`, not `getMin` / `getMax`.** `TextFieldState` already has
numeric `min` and `max` for a spin button, and spreading a `DateValue` into those would either fail to compile
or set a nonsense attribute; renaming is cheaper than an `Omit` plus a hand-written pass-through. There is no
`onInput` either: the consumer owns the signal, so an effect over it sees every change.

**`DatePicker` is `DateInput` plus `Calendar` in a `Popover`, and the trigger lives in the field's trailing
slot** — the slot that existed for `NumberInput`'s stepper, needing no widening. The visible month is the
picker's own signal, snapped to the value each time the popup opens, which is what `Calendar`'s required
`monthSignal` was left public for. Typing a date and picking one agree without either knowing about the other:
both write the same value signal, and the calendar follows it.

**Dismissal repeats `ColorInput`'s arrangement**, outside-`pointerdown` plus `Escape` — the third dismissal
story in the repo, and the count is the argument rather than any one of them.

**Paint is four slots**, matching `ColorInput` and `Select`: the field's `renderContent`, `renderTrigger`,
`renderDay`, `renderWeekday`, and `renderPopup` for the surround, which receives the month signal so the
consumer draws the title and paging buttons.

### The mask: only digits are typed, and the caret is computed rather than preserved

Settled, on the user's call to try a mask rather than the element-per-segment shape every other library uses.
The primitive two shipped fields were waiting on.

**What the survey found, kept here because it is the argument against the shape that was chosen.** React Aria
renders one focusable, editable segment per date unit, each a spin button in its own right, and says so as the
point of the design: any locale order, in any calendar system, without a browser input mask. MUI moved to the
same shape in v7, replacing the single `<input>` with a list of sections behind an
`enableAccessibleFieldDOMStructure` prop, so that ARIA attributes can sit on each section. An element per
segment does not solve the display-form-versus-value-form problem; it makes it not arise, because there is no
single string to be in two forms. **And no component library owns a mask at all** — MUI's own text-field
documentation covers formatting by swapping the inner input for `react-imask` or `react-number-format`, so
everywhere it appears it is a dependency rather than a component. That is the gap this primitive fills, and it
is why exporting it was worth doing.

**`TextSyncUtils.applyMask(pattern, previous, next, caret)` is a pure function, so the caret arithmetic is
reachable from `npm test`.** A pattern is `#` for a digit slot and any other character as a literal, so
`dd/mm/yyyy` is `##/##/####`. It returns the text and where the caret belongs; `TextSync.utils.test.ts` covers
the cases that are easy to get wrong.

**Only the digits carry meaning.** Everything that is not a digit is discarded on the way in and re-emitted
from the pattern on the way out. That single rule makes typing `25122026`, pasting `25/12/2026`, pasting
`25.12.2026` and pasting ` 25 12 2026` all land the same value, and it is why the caret cannot simply be
preserved: the position that survives an edit is _how many digits precede it_, and the text offset is derived
from that afterwards.

**Deleting a literal deletes the digit in front of it.** Backspacing the slash in `12/34` would otherwise
strip a character the mask immediately puts back, so the key would read as broken. The tell is that the digit
count did not change across an edit that shortened the text.

**The mask lives in `TextSync` because it owns the caret, and a transforming setter cannot.** The owner's
setter runs after the browser has written the text; it can refuse or rewrite a value but cannot move a caret
it never saw, and a caret left where the keystroke put it lands before the separator the mask just inserted.
`createValueSync` therefore takes an optional `getMask` and, when there is one, writes the masked text, sets
the caret and reports upward — instead of reporting first and syncing back.

**One consequence, accepted: inserting into the middle shifts rather than overwrites.** Typing a digit into
the middle of a complete date pushes every later digit along and drops the last, because the mask holds a
digit string and not a set of fixed-width fields. Overwrite-in-place is what per-segment elements give free,
and it is the main thing this shape does not.

**What a mask cannot do at all**, which is the line where segments would come back: with one input the browser
draws the whole string, so nothing can tint or box the segment the caret is in, and nothing can be placed
_between_ two segments. What it keeps is everything about the field being one input — `renderLeading` /
`renderTrailing` untouched, the measured adornment inset still applying, `computeTextStyle` still styling the
value. Verified on the masked `DatePicker`.

### Controls: `DateInput`'s format states the order, and the mask follows from it

Settled, with the mask. `getFormat` takes `"iso"`, `"day-month-year"` or `"month-day-year"`,
defaulting to ISO.

**An arbitrary mask string is deliberately not the prop.** A consumer passing `##/##/####` directly would
leave the component guessing which slots were the month, and a pattern the parse does not agree with is a
field that reads a date wrong in silence. So the order is stated and the pattern derived from it — one source
of truth, the argument the discriminated `SelectItem` record makes.

**`fromIso` is still the only thing that decides whether a date exists.** The display order is reassembled
into `yyyy-mm-dd` and handed to it, so 31 February is refused in every order rather than once per order, and no
second validator exists to disagree with the first.

**ISO is masked too, on the same path.** It could have kept its unmasked branch and did not, because two
paths would be two behaviours to keep in step. Nothing observable changed: a typed `-` is discarded and the
mask supplies its own.

**`TextSyncUtils` is not exported from `index.ts` yet.** `DateInput` is its only consumer and the standing
rule is private until a second arrives — which will be `TimeInput`'s 12-hour clock or the formatted number,
either of which is also the moment to decide whether a consumer building their own masked field should reach
it. _`TimeInput` became that second consumer; the export decision is still open._

### A masked field shows the separator it wants next, and never deletes what it could not read

Both settled, from the user testing the fields and finding them, in their words, broken. One
complaint: **a field must say what it is waiting for, and must never answer a mistake by throwing the mistake
away.**

**The separator arrives with the group before it, not the digit after it.** Four digits into `####-##-##` the
text is `2026-` with the caret after the dash. The old rule was the opposite and is argued a few paragraphs up
— a half-finished field never held a trailing separator, so nothing had to decide whether an incomplete value
ended at a digit or at punctuation. A real simplification bought at the reader's expense: typing `2020` into an
ISO field gave no sign that a month was wanted next, or that the dash would be supplied rather than typed.
Nothing downstream cared, because every consumer of the text counts digits rather than characters.

The deletion rule is unchanged and now does more work: backspacing over a separator still removes the digit in
front of it, so two presses remove two digits rather than a digit and a dash. What changes is where it stops —
`25/12/` loses the `2` and becomes `25/1`, keeping the separator its first group earns.

**An unreadable field keeps its text and reports an error.** `DateInput` and `TimeInput` used to rewrite the
text from the value whenever the field was left, and with no value that meant erasing what had been typed:
entering `2020-20-20` and tabbing away left an empty field and no explanation. The rewrite now runs only when
there is a value to rewrite from.

**Wrong and unfinished are different, and they report at different moments.** A spelling that cannot exist —
the 20th month, `29:99`, a date outside `getMinDate` / `getMaxDate` — is wrong the instant the last digit
lands, and errors immediately while the field still has focus. A half-typed value is not wrong yet; saying so
mid-keystroke would be noise, so it errors only once the field is left, and typing again clears that. Both
surface through the flag the painter already reads: `getHasError` is the consumer's own prop **or** the
field's own judgment, so a consumer who passes nothing still gets a field that says no.

This is what `hasError` on sixteen controls was waiting for a producer to do, and the producer turned out to be
the control itself rather than the form story `backlog.md` files it under.

**The value is still cleared when the text cannot be read.** The error is about the text; the owner is told
there is no date, which is true. What changed is that the field stops agreeing with the owner by going blank.

**A part that cannot exist is refused before the rest of the value does.** Added the same day, on the user's
observation that a 13th month is already wrong without waiting for a day: `TextSyncUtils.readGroups` reads the
**complete** fixed-width groups of the digits typed so far and range-checks each on its own — month 1-12, day
1-31, hour 0-23 or 1-12 on a 12-hour clock, minute and second 0-59. A group still being typed is not reported,
so `1` never has to answer for the month it might become.

The bounds are per-part rather than per-value: the day's ceiling is the longest month, because a 30 February is
two parts _disagreeing_ rather than one part being impossible, and that stays `fromIso`'s to catch. Three
checks in order — impossible part, complete-value parse and bounds, then unfinished — each reporting at the
earliest moment it can be sure.

**Not extended to an impossible _prefix_**, though the same argument reaches it: a month whose first digit is 2
can only become 20-29 and is already doomed. Refusing it needs the field to reason about what a group could
still become, and the published answer to that case is auto-advance — typing `2` fills `02` and moves on —
which is a different feature with its own keyboard consequences.

### A masked field offers the placeholder that matches its own mask

`renderPlaceholder` is `(getFlags, hint)`, where `hint` is `yyyy-mm-dd`, `dd/mm/yyyy`,
`hh:mm` or `hh:mm:ss` depending on what the field is spelling. A consumer wanting something else ignores the
argument; the Playground's eight variants stopped carrying eight hand-written strings, three of which were
wrong — every time field said `yyyy-mm-dd`.

**It comes from the format, not from the mask string.** The hint and the pattern are two renderings of one
definition (the ordered parts and the separator), so `computeHint` sits beside `computeMask` and reads the
same record. Deriving the hint by rewriting `####-##-##` would need a second thing to know that the first
group is a year — the guessing _"an arbitrary mask string is deliberately not the prop"_ avoids.

**It is a plain string rather than an accessor**, following `Calendar.renderWeekday`'s `name`: the painter
reads it inside a tracking scope, so a format change re-renders it anyway.

The prop behind it is `getPlaceholderHint` on `TextField`, `Omit`ted by `DateInput` and `TimeInput` for the
reason they omit `getMask` — they own the format. A hand-built `TextField` or `TextInput` sets neither and its
painter is handed `undefined`.

### `ContextMenu`: the same menu, opened by a right-click at a point

Settled while closing the last of `backlog.md` item 4's opener bullets. What differs between a menu on a
button and a menu on a right-click is the opener, not the menu — so the level, the items, the submenus, the
typeahead, the keyboard and the dismissal are all the ones `Menu` already has.

**It is a second component rather than a mode, because a right-click menu has no button to render.** `Menu`
is a trigger plus a root level, and its trigger is a real `<button>` with a name, a tab stop and an
`aria-expanded` — none of which a context menu has any use for. A `hasTrigger` flag would have left an empty
button in the tab order, or an `InteractionWrapper` wrapping a control that is not there. `ContextMenu`
renders the level and nothing else. This is also what the published libraries do: Radix ships a whole
`ContextMenu` over the same menu internals, and Ark UI adds a second trigger part rather than a second menu.

**The region is the consumer's element, handed over as `regionRef`.** The library cannot render it — it is
whatever area the menu belongs to, a canvas, a row, a whole page — so it is a ref, and the component attaches
the `contextmenu` listener to it. That the listener is the library's rather than the consumer's is the point:
the point has to be converted out of client coordinates into the space the positioner works in, and a
consumer cannot be expected to know that a `Viewport` may be scaling everything around them.

**The point is a rect of no size, which is what let this be built with nothing new underneath.**
`Anchor.createPortalPosition` already took an optional `getAnchorRect` for `Spotlight`, so a zero-size rect at
the pointer is an anchor like any other: the default placement puts the popup's near corner on it, and the
same edge-safety logic flips it near a screen edge. `Popover` gained the one prop that threads it through.

**A popup with an explicit rect drops its anchor from the dismiss roots, and that reversal is deliberate.**
`Popover` normally treats the anchor element as part of its own layer, so pressing a toggle button does not
dismiss the popup before the button's handler can toggle it. A point-anchored popup is the opposite case: the
anchor is a whole region rather than a button, and a plain left-click inside it has to dismiss the menu like
any other press outside. The right-click that re-opens the menu elsewhere in the region is unaffected —
`pointerdown` dismisses first and `contextmenu` opens again at the new point, so the menu appears to move.

**The menu names itself, because there is no trigger to be named by.** `MenuLevel` labelled its popup with
the trigger's id; it now takes an `ariaLabel` beside that, and `ContextMenu` requires one.

### Dismissal is one stack, and `Popover` is the layer

Settled, replacing five stories: `Select` closed on its field's blur, `Menu` on its popup's
blur, `DatePicker` and `ColorInput` each ran their own document-wide press listener, and `Modal` its own
document `keydown`.

**`DismisserStack` is a module-level array of open layers with one set of document listeners**, in the
`LiveAnnouncer` position — it belongs to no component and there is one of it. Not owned by `Viewport`: a
consumer with no `Viewport` still needs dismissal, the events are the document's rather than any element's,
and nesting a `Viewport` inside a `Viewport` would need cross-authority ordering a single array does not have.

**A press or a focus move is positional; `Escape` is a stack operation.** Every layer the target sits outside
of hears about a press or a focus move, which closes a whole menu tree at once and is what
`getIsWithinOwnedLayer` keeps from closing a parent when the press was inside a child. `Escape` goes to the
innermost layer and stops — the bug this fixed: every control handled `Escape` locally and let the key travel
on, so a popup dismissed inside a `Modal` took the `Modal` with it. `modal.spec.ts` drives it over a `Select`
inside the modal on `ModalPage`.

**The reason reaches the consumer, because the right response differs by reason.** `DatePicker` and
`ColorInput` return focus to their field on `Escape` and do not on a press, since moving focus to a field
someone just clicked away from is wrong. A submenu closes only its own level whatever the reason; `Tab` still
closes the whole menu, from the menu's own key handler, before focus moves.

**`Popover` registers the layer, so its four consumers get dismissal by existing.** Roots are the popup
element and the anchor. The controls kept `onDismiss` shaped as their own close paths and lost their
listeners, their `onBlur` plumbing and `Menu`'s `computeIsInsideMenu` walk.

**Window blur no longer closes anything.** `focusout` with no `relatedTarget` is ignored, so switching apps
leaves a popup open where `Select`'s old field blur would have closed it. That matches Radix, and it is why a
focus move alone is not enough — the press listener covers a click on dead space.

### The am/pm segment is a control in the trailing slot, not a slot in the mask

Settled, on the user's suggestion, removing the extension the mask looked like it needed. A
12-hour field was the reason to add a non-digit slot to the pattern; putting the meridiem in `renderTrailing`
means **the pattern stays digits-only** and nothing about the mask changes.

**It is `renderTrailing` widened, not a new slot, and not `renderDecoration`.** `TimeInput` re-declares that
slot as `(getFlags, meridiem)`, exactly what `NumberInput` does with its stepper — both would want the same
physical position, and one slot lets a painter draw a unit and a control together. The decoration overlay
cannot host this at all: one full-box overlay inheriting `pointer-events: none`, so a control inside it is
unclickable, and it is not positional.

**The value stays 24-hour and the meridiem is a way of reading it.** `TimeValue` gains no fourth field.
`TimeValueUtils.getMeridiem` / `getTwelveHour` / `withMeridiem` / `fromTwelveHour` are pure and tested, and
they are tested because **midnight reads as 12 am and noon as 12 pm** — the mapping is not `hour % 12` in
either direction, and nothing in the type system catches an off-by-twelve. Keeping 24-hour form also makes the
hard case free: stepping the hour past eleven carries into the next half of the day with no arithmetic of its
own, because the meridiem is derived from the hour rather than stored beside it.

**The meridiem is nonetheless a signal, and only because of the empty field.** With no value there is no hour
to read it off, and a consumer who chooses "pm" before typing has to have that remembered. Whenever a value
exists it wins — an effect pushes the value's own meridiem back into the signal — so the two cannot disagree
about a time that is actually held. The parse reads the signal `untrack`ed, per the mirror rule.

**Accepted consequence: it is a second tab stop.** Native `<input type="time">` makes am/pm a third segment
inside one control, reachable by arrow keys. Here it is a `Button` in the trailing slot with its own focus
ring, the same call recorded for a two-thumb `Range`. It has to carry a name: the Playground's toggle sets
`aria-label` to "Before or after noon: AM", because the glyph is `aria-hidden` like every painter's text.

**`TimeInput` uses the mask too, as of.** It did not, and the paragraph here argued that was
deliberate; the user found out what it meant by typing `203` and getting `203` rather than `20:3`. The
reasoning was sound about not bundling and wrong about the outcome: a field whose twin punctuates itself and
which does not is not a smaller feature, it is an inconsistency the reader hits immediately.
`computeMask(segmentCount)` builds `##:##` or `##:##:##` from the same constants the caret arithmetic uses, so
the two cannot drift, and the segment stride is unchanged because a mask emits exactly the fixed-width
segments the arithmetic assumed.

### Controls: `TimeInput`, and stepping the segment the caret is in

Settled, immediately after `DateInput` and on the same shape.

**`TimeValue` is `{ hour, minute, second? }` and mirrors `DateValue` deliberately**: a record rather than a
`Date`, its own arithmetic, `Intl` only for formatting. No midday trick, because a time of day carries no zone
— which is also why `second` is optional in a way `DateValue`'s fields are not: a time to the minute and a
time to the second are both complete values, and the shape says which one a consumer holds.

**Everything compares through `getSecondOfDay`**, so a value with seconds and one without mix safely: `09:00`
and `09:00:00` are the same time and `isSame` says so. Field-by-field comparison would make those different,
which shows up as a filter quietly dropping rows.

**Stepping wraps around the day; typing does not.** `addUnit` carries between segments and wraps at midnight,
because a clock has no end. A **typed** time is refused instead: `24:00` reports no value rather than becoming
midnight, on `fromIso`'s rule. Bounds behave the same way in both directions: a stepped value clamps, a typed
one outside the range is simply not a value.

**The arrow keys step whichever segment the caret is in, and then select it.** The segment is derived from the
caret offset — three characters per segment including its separator — so no per-segment elements and no mask
are needed. Selecting the stepped segment afterwards is what makes a run of presses work: the caret would
otherwise drift and the second press would land on a different unit. The one part of the control with no
precedent in the repo, and why `TimeInput` takes `onKeyDown` for itself rather than passing it through.

**The time popup is `Clock`, and it is a column per unit.** The paragraph here used to say there was no
popup and that a list of generated times in a `Popover` would be one; the second half is what was
reconsidered, and why is under `Controls: Clock` below.

### Controls: `Clock`, and why a time popup is columns rather than a list

Settled on the user's call, after the two shapes were weighed side by side.

**The name pairs with `Calendar`.** `Calendar` is the standalone surface a date is picked from and
`DatePicker` is the field plus that surface in a popup; `Clock` and `TimePicker` are the same two things for
a time. Neither surface knows anything about a popup, which is what lets the Playground put a calendar on a
page of its own and would let a consumer do the same with a clock.

**One column per unit, not one list of times.** The list shape is the obvious one — 09:00, 09:15, 09:30, the
thing a booking site shows — and it is what this file used to predict. It was rejected on a single point:
`TimeInput` accepts `getHasSeconds`, and a list at seconds granularity is 86,400 rows. The picker would then
have had to refuse a value the field beside it accepts, which is the one failure a paired field and popup
cannot have. Columns have no such ceiling: the longest is 60 rows whatever the granularity, and the same
`hasSeconds` and `isTwelveHour` accessors drive both halves, so the two cannot disagree about what a time is.

The cost, accepted: picking a time is two or three separate acts rather than one, and the keyboard walk
crosses columns as well as running down one.

**An option carries the whole time it would produce, not just its own number.** Each option is
`{ unit, time, label }` where `time` is the current value with that one unit replaced. Everything else falls
out of it: the option is disabled when that time is outside the bounds, selected when the value already reads
that way, and picking it writes that time. It also gives the honest reading of a bound — with opening hours
of 09:00 to 17:30 and a value of 09:47, the hour option 17 is disabled, because 17:47 is shut.

**The label is the library's, and that is a departure from `Calendar`.** `Calendar` hands the painter a
`DateValue` and lets it draw `day.day`; `Clock` hands over a finished string. Two reasons, and the first is
the load-bearing one: a twelve-hour column reads 12, 01 … 11 rather than 00 … 11, and the conversion is the
one `TimeUtils` documents as easy to get wrong — midnight is 12 am and noon is 12 pm, so it is not `hour % 12`
in either direction. A painter deriving that itself would be re-deriving the exact arithmetic that was moved
into `ss-utils` to stop it being re-derived. Second, the am/pm label is locale text, not a number.

**Twelve is the first row, not the last.** The column runs 12, 01 … 11, because that is the order the hours
fall in — twelve am is midnight. Listing 01 … 12 would put midnight at the bottom.

**The column names come from `Intl.DisplayNames`, and the am/pm words from `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.** A
listbox has to carry a name, and inventing "Hour" in English would bake one language into the library.
`Intl.DisplayNames` with `type: "dateTimeField"` answers `hour`, `minute`, `second` and `dayPeriod` per
locale — "Stunde" in German, "am/pm" in `en-GB` — and it has been in every browser since April 2021, so it
needs no fallback. The am/pm words are read off `formatToParts` of a formatter forced to `hour12: true`,
picking out the `dayPeriod` part, because the words are the locale's and no list of them belongs here.

**The visible column heading sits outside the listbox, and the options sit inside it.** A listbox may
contain options and groups; a heading among them is noise a screen reader has to step over. So the library
draws four levels — a `role="group"` for the whole clock, a plain column, a heading whose content is
`renderUnit`'s, and the `role="listbox"` around the options — and the painter's scrolling box goes inside
the listbox through `renderColumn`, which is where `Select` already put the painter's panel. Keeping
`max-height` and `overflow` out of the library's props is the same argument as there.

**With no value, the fallback time is pulled inside the bounds.** The base a column mutates is the value, or
the current time when there is none. Left unclamped, a bounded clock opened at 22:00 with opening hours of
09:00 to 17:30 has every option in its minute column disabled — each would produce 22-something — so the
picker looks broken until the user happens to pick an hour first. `TimeUtils.clamp` on the fallback fixes it
outright and costs nothing when a value exists.

**Selection is one tab stop over the whole clock, as in `Calendar`.** Up and down move within a column and
wrap; left and right cross to the next column, landing on its reading of the same time; Home and End go to
the ends of a column; only Enter or Space commits. Moving the highlight deliberately does not select, so a
walk across three columns does not write three times. The roving position is stored as **one whole time**
rather than a per-column index, which is what makes crossing columns free — the new column simply reads the
same time its own way.

**Two bugs found building it, both worth knowing because neither is visible in the source.**

An effect that focuses the roving option had its early return _above_ the line that reads the highlight, so
on the first run — when nothing inside the clock has focus yet — the effect finished without ever subscribing
to the highlight and never ran again. Focus then stayed on whichever option it started on while the highlight
walked away. `Calendar`'s equivalent reads its roving day above the guard and is correct by accident of
ordering. **Read every signal an effect depends on before the first `return`.**

And the whole column re-rendered on every value change, destroying the focused option and dropping focus to
the body. The column's children expression read `getColumn().unit`, and the column object is rebuilt whenever
the base time changes, so the expression re-ran and called `renderColumn` again — a fresh `Index`, fresh
elements. A `createMemo` over the unit stops it: the memo only notifies when the string actually changes,
which for a given column is never. **A slot called inside a reactive expression is re-invoked whenever
anything that expression reads changes, so what it reads has to be narrowed to what it actually needs.**

### Controls: `TimePicker`, and the trailing slot carrying two controls

**It is `DatePicker`'s arrangement, part for part**: the field, the surface, a `Popover` between them, the
open state a `SignalMirror` so a consumer may own it, `Escape` returning focus to the input and an outside
press leaving it alone. Nothing here was decided again.

**The one thing `DatePicker` did not have to solve is that the trailing slot was already taken.** On a
twelve-hour field the am/pm control lives there. `DatePicker` could give the trigger a slot of its own —
`renderTrigger` — because a date field's trailing slot was empty. Rather than add a second slot,
`TimePicker` widens the existing one a third time: `renderTrailing` becomes
`(getFlags, meridiem, trigger)` and the painter draws both, or neither, or only the trigger on a
twenty-four-hour field. This is the arrangement the am/pm decision already anticipated — one slot lets a
painter place a unit and a control together, and the physical position both want is the same.

**Both pickers forward a per-item disabled predicate, and `DatePicker` gained its one here.** `Calendar`
had always taken `computeIsDayDisabled` and `DatePicker` never passed it through, so a consumer wanting to
grey out weekends had to drop down to `Calendar` and build the popup themselves. The bounds a picker takes
are a range, and a range cannot express "not on a Sunday" — closing that was the user's call, taken
separately from the work that surfaced it rather than carried along inside it.

### `Button` can be named, and the label wins over the painter

Settled, closing the gap `Calendar`'s paging buttons exposed: a painter drawing only a glyph
left the button announcing "black left-pointing triangle".

**`ariaLabel` joins `InteractionControlProps`**, so it is the wrapper's to hand every leaf rather than each
leaf's to invent, and `ButtonProps` picks it up through the same pass-through `id` and `renderContent` use.
Only `Button` applies it so far; a leaf with its own naming story keeps it (`BinarySwitch` reads the `Label`
context, `TextField` names its input).

**It goes through `LabelUtils.resolveAriaLabel`, so the `Label` rule is inherited rather than restated.**
Inside a `Label` the prop is suppressed and warned about.

**Against painter text, the label wins, and that is the platform's rule rather than a choice.** An
`aria-label` overrides descendant text as the accessible name. There is no way to detect that a painter drew
words, so this cannot be warned about; the requirement that a painter mark decorative glyphs `aria-hidden` is
the other half. The Playground briefly used a visually-hidden span instead, which worked and is gone: it made
every icon button carry a clip-rect idiom the consumer had to know.

### The 0..1 guarantee belongs to `computeCellWeights`, not to each formula

Three formulas leave the range a weight is defined on, and always for the same reason: they are built for
whole-number distances, and a centred origin on an even count makes the farthest bound a half-integer. `spiral`
subtracts its raw result from 1 and divides, so a result below 1 lifts the weight above it. `radar` divides by
`maxWeight - 1`, and measured on an eight-by-eight grid with a centred origin `radarSingle` reached -0.019,
`radarDouble` -0.038 and `radarQuad` -0.083. `checkeredConvergent` reached -0.071 on the same grid and -0.25 on
every cell of a two-by-two.

**So the clamp sits in `computeCellWeights`, once, on the user's call.** It is the only place that knows a
weight is contractually a position on the timeline between 0 and 1, and per-formula clamps had already been
added twice while a third case sat unnoticed. The two that existed are gone, so no formula clamps its own
return any more, and a new sample cannot forget to.

**What the clamp deliberately does not do is re-derive the formulas.** Dividing `radar` by `maxWeight`, or
rounding `spiral`'s distances before it runs, would be the principled fix in each case and would move every
measured weight on every grid, including the ones nobody complained about — and measured values are the user's
call, not something to re-bless while closing a range violation. So the extremes stay shared where two cells
share them, and the tests pin the range across every deterministic entry on the grids that overshoot rather
than pinning the old out-of-range numbers.

### The form story: the library wires, the consumer validates

Settled, on the user's call. It closes the largest open item, and the decision is the whole of
it.

**Validation is not the library's.** No validator prop, no required / min / max / pattern, no rule language.
Validation is application logic — schemas, async server checks, rules spanning fields — and a library that
owns it ends up with a half-built rule language nobody can extend, plus two sources of truth the moment a rule
needs another field's value. `hasError` stays what it was: a prop the owner sets. What changes is that it now
has somewhere to go.

**What the library owns is association and announcement.** `FormField` generates the ids and wires a control
to its message; `Form` collects what its fields **report** and never computes anything. Those two are the
whole surface.

**`FormField` publishes a context and the control reads it, which is `Label`'s shape reused.**
`FormFieldUtils.resolveAriaDescribedBy` sits beside `LabelUtils.resolveAriaLabel` and merges the context's
message id with any `aria-describedby` the consumer passed, so the consumer wires nothing. The alternative —
handing ids out through a render prop to thread — puts an accessibility relationship in application code where
a missing attribute fails silently.

**An error message is a live region; a hint is not.** The message element takes `role="alert"` only while the
field reports an error, so an error that appears is read out and a standing hint is not re-read on every
render. A message that empties takes the description reference with it, so a control is never described by
nothing.

**`Form` collects entries the way `RadioGroup` collects radios.** Each `FormField` registers
`{ getHasError }` during setup and cleans itself up; `getIsValid` is the memo over all of them. A submit
button reads it through the context, so disabling itself needs no state of its own. Registration rather than a
data-driven list, because a form's fields are written as markup rather than enumerated as records.

**`Form` renders a real `<form>` with `noValidate`, and prevents the default on both events.** The element
gives Enter-to-submit and reset for free; `noValidate` keeps the browser's own bubble from competing with the
messages the consumer draws. `hasSubmitted` is exposed because "show the errors only after the first attempt"
is the one piece of form state that is not a field's.

**A control does not hold its own error back until submit, and `hasSubmitted` is not for the errors it
raises.** Stated by the user. The split is by _who can answer the question_, not by when the
reader would rather hear it. A format, range or mask error is answerable from the field's own text the moment
it is typed, so hiding it until submit is a control keeping a secret from its reader. `hasSubmitted` exists
for the other kind: an answer only a server has — whether credentials are accepted, whether a name is taken.
So `DateInput` and `TimeInput` raising `hasError` from their own text is the other half of the same rule
rather than a conflict.

**`Button` gained `getType`.** A submit button has to be `<button type="submit">` and the leaf hardcoded
`"button"`. It defaults to `"button"`, so nothing changed for existing call sites.

**Every field reads the description context, and so does `SlideButton`.** `TextField` and `BinarySwitch` cover
`TextInput`, `TextArea`, `NumberInput`, `CurrencyInput`, `DateInput`, `TimeInput`, `Checkbox`, `Toggle` and
`Radio`; `Select`, `ColorInput`, `FileInput` and `Range` each make the same one-line call. `SlideButton` is the
one control that is not a field and reads it anyway — see the entry under its own heading. The plain `Button`,
`Menu` and the navigational controls do not, and nothing has asked.

### `FormSection`: the collecting stops at the nearest one

The piece item 6 had left of the form story. `Form` collected every field on the page and there was no way to
say that a run of fields belongs together, which left two things with nowhere to go: a heading over a group,
and a rule that is true of a group rather than of any one field in it.

**A section provides a `FormContext` of its own and registers itself with the one outside it.** That is the
whole implementation, and it is why neither `Form` nor `FormField` changed by a line. A field registers with
the nearest collector — its section if it is inside one, the form otherwise — and a section reports one
verdict upward to whatever is collecting above it. Sections nest for free by the same rule, and nothing is
counted twice, because a field is only ever heard by one collector.

**What a section reports is `!isValid`, and `isValid` is its own rule plus every entry inside it.** The own
rule is `hasError`, set by the owner exactly as it is on `FormField` — validation is still not the library's.
This is the half that could not be expressed before: "these two passwords do not match" is answerable from
neither field alone, so neither field can carry it, and both are individually fine while the form still has
to refuse.

**`getHasSubmitted` passes straight through from the enclosing form.** A section is not submitted, so it has
no state of its own to report there; a submit button inside a section reads the section's validity and the
form's submitted flag, which is the honest answer to both questions. In practice nothing hits that case,
because `Form` hands its own state to `renderContent` and a submit button reads it from there.

**It renders a real `<fieldset>` and a real `<legend>`, and the legend is the whole naming mechanism.** A
`<fieldset>` is `role="group"` already, so the library adds no role; the legend names the group with no
generated id and no `aria-labelledby`, which is the same argument `FormField` makes about ids — an
accessibility relationship threaded through consumer markup fails silently when a strand is dropped.
`ariaLabel` is there for a section with no visible caption; a legend, when present, is what names it.

**A section cannot mark itself invalid, and that is a fact about ARIA rather than a choice.** `aria-invalid`
is not global: it is supported on `checkbox`, `combobox`, `gridcell`, `listbox`, `radiogroup`, `slider`,
`spinbutton`, `textbox`, `tree` and `application`, and `group` is not among them — which is why `RadioGroup`
may carry it and this may not. So the only route to a section-level rule is the text of it, and the message
is wired both ways: `role="alert"` while the section reports an error, so it is read out when it appears, and
`aria-describedby` on the fieldset, so it is still reachable to someone navigating into the group afterwards.
Without that pair, `hasError` on a section would be a state with no accessible surface at all, which
WCAG 3.3.1 asks for in text.

**The UA paint is stripped, and it is the only element in the library that needs stripping.** A `<fieldset>`
arrives with a border, padding, margin and `min-inline-size: min-content`, none of which the library chose;
`<legend>` arrives with padding. Both are reset with `!important`, for the reason the `TextField` resets carry
it — element-level styling is what every reset stylesheet ships, and a blank slate that loses to an element
selector is broken. The consequence worth stating: the border-with-a-gap-for-the-legend look a fieldset is
known for is the UA's, and it is gone, so a consumer wanting a box paints one inside `renderContent`. A
`<div role="group" aria-labelledby>` was the alternative — it is what `Select` already does for an option
group — and it was not taken, because it buys the same box back at the cost of generating an id and wiring a
label reference that the platform will do for nothing.

**The legend is not a flex item.** A `<fieldset>` with `display: flex` puts its content in an anonymous flex
box and leaves the legend outside it, so `dir` and `gap` lay out the fields and the message while the caption
always sits above them. That differs from `FormField`, where the caption is a flex item and `dir: "row"`
puts it beside the control, and it is the platform's arrangement rather than a decision.

### `Button` reports the pointer, and `NumberInput` repeats while held

Settled, on the user's call.

**`ButtonCbs` gained `onPointerDown` and `onPointerUp`**, both gated on disabled like every other callback
there. `pointercancel` is routed to `onPointerUp` as well: a drag that leaves the button, a touch the browser
takes over for scrolling, or a context menu all cancel rather than release, and a control that started
repeating on down must stop in every case or it never stops. Pointer events rather than mouse ones because they
cover touch and pen without a second pair.

**The repeat itself is the library's, not the painter's.** `NumberInputStepper` grew `startSteppingUp`,
`startSteppingDown` and `stopStepping`; the painter calls them from the pointer events and owns no timer. A
painter running its own interval would be four lines of behaviour duplicated in every consumer's stepper, and
behaviour is the shell's — the argument that put the auto-dismiss clock inside `Toasts`.

**Both timings are props with defaults, because they are tuned values.** `getRepeatDelayMs` at 400 and
`getRepeatIntervalMs` at 60 match a native spin button, and they are exposed rather than baked because a
consumer with a slow store or a coarse step wants different numbers.

**A tap still steps exactly once.** `startStepping` steps immediately and only then arms the delay, so the
first step is not deferred and releasing before the delay leaves that single step behind. Both halves are
pinned in `numberInput.spec.ts`, since a repeat that starts too eagerly is indistinguishable from a working one
until someone taps.

**The painter also stops on `mouseleave`.** Pointer capture is not used here, so dragging off the button would
otherwise keep repeating with nothing under the cursor. That is the painter's call rather than the library's,
and the one part of the arrangement the shell does not enforce.

### `SignalMirror`, and the form wiring finished

Settled, closing two unblocked items in one pass.

**Every control here owns its value as a `*Signal`, and a consumer holding a getter plus a callback had to
build the same mirror by hand.** `PageTextField`, `PageSelectField`, `PageCheckField`, `PageNumberField` and
`PageColorField` were five copies, and the colour picker's hue slider made a sixth.
`SignalMirror.createMirror(getOuter, setOuter, opts)` is that mirror once, with `createValueMirror` for the
common case where nothing converts.

**It takes a getter and a setter rather than a `Signal`**, the escape hatch `backlog.md` named as the
alternative to a signal-only surface. A consumer with a signal passes its two halves; one with a store field,
route param or callback passes those. The first attempt took a `Signal` and could not express any of the
Playground's own wrappers.

**Each direction reads the far side `untrack`ed**, which is the whole reason this is worth extracting: the two
colour-picker bugs were both a mirror whose guard tracked the other side, so an unrelated change re-ran it and
wrote a stale half back.

**It converts only when the value changes, so a half-written inner value survives.** Typing `7.0` into a
field mirroring a number leaves the text alone, because the number did not change — the rule the hex and date
fields needed, now free for anything built on it.

**It is not unit tested, deliberately.** A mirror is two effects and a scheduler, not a function of its
arguments. Its four consumers are driven in `e2e/`, where its behaviour is observable.

**The form wiring is complete.** `Select`, `ColorInput`, `FileInput` and `Range` now read the description
context alongside `TextField` and `BinarySwitch`, so every control that can sit in a `FormField` points at its
message without the consumer wiring anything.

### A `Viewport` is a region, and it is terminal for everything inside it

Settled, from `ViewportPage`. A viewport fits the size it is designed for into **the space it
is given**: the root's space is the window, a nested one's is the box the page puts it in. The app's own
viewport is not a special kind — it is the one whose region happens to be everything.

**The host is what clips.** Each viewport renders a host box (`overflow: hidden`, filling its container) with
the scaled design box inside. Since every layer opened inside a viewport is portalled into _that_ viewport's
own portal, one `overflow: hidden` is the whole of "nothing inside a viewport paints outside it": a dropdown
from a control in a nested viewport is clipped by that viewport, not by the window. A nested one measures its
host with a `ResizeObserver`, so the consumer sizes it with ordinary CSS and nothing is passed in.

**Scale multiplies through and the rect is carried into window pixels.** A child was handed the innermost
scale while the screen showed every enclosing scale multiplied, so `getAdjustedBoundingClientRect` — and
through it every anchored layer — was wrong by the outer factor. `getScale` is now the parent's times its own,
and `getScaledRect` composes the host's client rect with the local fit through
`ViewportUtils.composeScaledRect`, which is unit-tested as plain arithmetic on plain rects. That one is read
rather than memoised: the host moves whenever anything above it scrolls, and it is what every anchored layer
measures against, once per frame.

**The transform stays local.** CSS already composes an ancestor's transform, so each root writes its own
`translate` and `scale` in its host's coordinates and nothing accumulates twice.

**That the two factors multiply is now driven rather than only unit-tested**, and the trick is to shrink the
window. The Playground's own viewport is drawn at `1` whenever the window's height matches the size it
anchors to, which is every machine it has ever run on — its fit works out to the window's height over that
anchor whichever way the aspect ratio falls, because the design size is derived from the ratio too. So
`viewport.spec.ts` sets the inner square to half, halves the window, and reads a quarter back off both the
viewport's own report and a control measured two levels in: its painted height over its layout height.
Without the resize the outer factor is `1` and any product looks like the inner factor alone.

**A stack of toasts raised inside a nested viewport stays inside it**, examined rather than assumed. It
portals into that viewport's own portal like every other layer, is clipped by the same `overflow: hidden`,
and is the thing painted at its own position — so its fixed `z-index`, chosen against `Modal`'s and never put
through the anchor-relative rule the popups use, costs nothing here: the region is a child of the portal, and
what a portal paints over is decided by the portal's own place in the tree rather than by a number inside it.
`ViewportPage` raises one so the case stays driven.

**An earlier attempt had a nested viewport fill its parent instead**, mounted into the parent's content box by
a portal. It was wrong for the case that matters: a viewport you cannot place cannot be the boundary of
anything smaller than the window, and the boundary is the point.

### The viewport is terminal, and an anchored layer tracks its anchor rather than polling for it

Settled, from three defects seen on `ViewportPage`.

**When perfect placement is impossible, the layer is clipped — never shrunk and never moved over the
anchor.** Three things could give: the layer's size, its distance from the anchor, or the part of it you can
see. The library gives up the last. `AnchorUtils.getBand` gives an `out` placement only the space between the
anchor and the edge it faces, and `clampToBand` pins the edge touching the anchor, letting the far edge run
past the viewport where `overflow: hidden` cuts it. An `in` or centred placement is deliberately over the
anchor and gets the whole viewport.

Pinning the other end — `Math.max(band.start, ...)` in both directions, the obvious clamp — is what makes a
list with nowhere to go slide down over the field it belongs to. Capping the layer's height to the band, tried
first, is the same mistake in the other axis: a list that quietly becomes a third of itself has answered a
question nobody asked. A layer keeps the size its painter chose.

**Scrolling is listened for as well as polled.** `createViewportRectObserver` measured once per animation
frame, leaving a portalled layer a frame behind an anchor being scrolled. It now also repositions from a
`scroll` listener in the capture phase — the event does not bubble, so capture is what hears a scrollable
ancestor — and from `resize`. The frame poll stays, because an anchor can also move under a CSS animation,
which no event reports.

**A portalled layer is placed by `transform`, not by `top` / `left`.** Writing offsets forced layout on every
frame of a scroll; a translate is composited. Both roots pin to `top: 0; left: 0` — an absolutely positioned
box with `auto` offsets would otherwise fall at its static position, which for the second layer in a portal is
not the first layer's.

**A nested viewport is opaque.** `viewportNestedRoot` carries a `z-index` above the parent's own portal layer,
so nothing behind a nested viewport paints through it or can be pointed at. Together with the root's
`overflow: hidden` and each viewport portalling into itself, that is the whole of "a viewport is a black box".
`viewport.spec.ts` drives all three.

### The date value carries its calendar system, and every bound is asked of it

Settled by the user, choosing to take `@internationalized/date` as a dependency rather than
read the calendars out of `Intl` by hand, and to support as many calendar systems as the package really
implements. The measured reasoning — what the platform contains, what the reverse conversion costs, why
`chinese` cannot be done this way — is in the entry below.

**`DateValue` is `CalendarDate`, aliased rather than wrapped.** A value carries its calendar, an era, a **year
within that era**, a month index and a day. The old `{ year, month, day }` record with a signed year is gone,
and with it every constant the library held about what a year is made of: month count, month length, month
names, grid row count and year ceiling are now questions asked of the value's own calendar through
`DateValueUtils`. Aliasing rather than wrapping is deliberate — a wrapper would have to re-expose `add`, `set`,
`cycle` and `compare` to be useful, and would then be a second date library.

**Thirteen calendars, and the list is explicit rather than the package's own.** `createCalendar` does not
refuse an identifier it has no implementation for: asked for `chinese`, `dangi`, `islamic` or `islamic-rgsa` it
returns a **Gregorian** calendar, so a consumer would get Gregorian dates labelled as something else with no
indication. `DateValueCalendarId` names the thirteen that map to themselves, and `getCalendarIds` is what a
consumer offers in a picker. The lunisolar calendars are excluded rather than half-supported — the same call as
`Table` being out of scope: a thing that looks supported and is not costs more than a thing that is absent.

**An era is a list the calendar reports, never a pair.** `getEras` returns `{ id, name }` for each — two for
Gregorian, one for Hebrew, five for Japanese. The names are not in the package, so they are read out of `Intl`
by formatting a date inside each era with `era: "long"`; finding a date inside era _n_ is a bisection over the
ISO year, since era index is monotone in time, and the result is cached per calendar and locale. A BC/AD toggle
was proposed and withdrawn: it is one calendar's model, and hardcoding it would put a Western assumption into
a control's API.

**The era is a control in `DateInput`'s leading slot, not a slot in the mask** — the am/pm arrangement in the
trailing slot, for the same reason: the mask carries digits only, an era identifier is not digits, and a
consumer paints it. `DateInput` hands `renderLeading` a `DateInputEra` with `getValue`, `getOptions` and `set`,
so the painter can draw a cycle button, a select, or nothing when the calendar reports a single era. The
Playground draws a cycle button and hides it below two eras, which is what React Aria does with its era
segment.

**The signed year is gone, and that is a gain.** A year before the common era is `era: "BC", year: 44` — no
negative numbers, and no off-by-one at the origin, because ISO's astronomical numbering is the package's
problem and stays inside `toIso` / `fromIso`. The cost is that a year past the end of an era, 12026 AD, can no
longer be _held_: the constructor constrains it to 9999 silently, so `fromIso` and `fromParts` compare the
built fields back against what was asked for and return `undefined` rather than passing a different date on.
**Anything built over this package must do that comparison** — `new CalendarDate(2026, 2, 31)` is February
28th, not an error.

**`getMonthGrid` takes an anchor value rather than a year and a month number**, because a month index means
nothing without the calendar it indexes. It still returns **six** week rows for every month of every supported
calendar — the fixed height predates this work, so paging never reflows the page — and six is enough because
no supported calendar has a month longer than 31 days.

**Two dates are the same day if they denote the same day, whatever calendar each is in.** `isSame` and
`compare` go through absolute day, so a Gregorian `min` bounds a Hebrew value and a date held in one system is
found in another system's grid. `DateInput` converts a value into the calendar it is configured for rather
than refusing it, so a consumer may hold Gregorian and show a Hebrew field over the same signal.

### `MaskedField`: the half every field over a typed value shares

Extracted, once `DateInput` and `TimeInput` had written the same thing twice and a formatted
number was about to write it a third time. `Abstracts/MaskedField` owns the private text signal, the effects
keeping it and the value in step, and the three moments at which a field reports a problem. What stays in each
control is what differs: its codec, its bounds, and whatever control it puts in a slot.

**The value arrives as a getter and a setter, not a `Signal`.** A control may not hand its own prop through
unchanged — `DateInput` converts the value into the calendar the field types in first — so the field cannot own
the signal. Same shape as `SignalMirror`, same reason.

**Completeness is counted in digits, and may be absent.** Only digits are typed, so a half-typed value is one
whose digit run is short; measuring the _text_ agrees while every group is a fixed width and stops agreeing the
moment one is not. `getDigitCount` returning `undefined` says the field has no notion of half-typed at all,
which is the honest answer for an amount.

**A value the codec refuses is reported to nobody, and the owner keeps the one it holds.** The commit effect
used to hand `undefined` outward whenever a complete digit run yielded nothing — the 31st of February, a 24th
hour, an amount over a field's maximum — so a field that had held a date all along spent a few keystrokes
telling its owner it was empty, and whatever read that value acted on it. It now commits only what the codec
accepts, plus the empty field itself: no digits still means no value, because that is what an empty field
means, and everything else waits. Two things fall out of it. The half-typed guard is gone, because a codec
that needs all its digits already answers `undefined` without them, which leaves `getDigitCount` to
`getHasIssue` alone. And blur restores the text from the held value, which is what a half-typed value already
did and what a refused one now does too — the field cannot clamp arbitrary text the way `NumberInput` clamps a
number, so going back to the last accepted value is the only settling available.

**The spelling follows the formatting as well as the value, and that needs its own effect.** Nothing else
catches a change of format on its own: switching an amount field's locale leaves the value and the digits
exactly as they were, so the effect comparing them stays quiet and the field goes on showing the old
punctuation. The text is rebuilt **from the value** rather than from the digits on screen, because the same six
digits are `1,234.56` at two decimal places and `123,456` at none.

**A control must not keep a second copy of something the value already carries.** `DateInput`'s era signal is
state _only_ for the empty field, and `fromDigits` reads the era off the held value. Reading the signal instead
made the two fight: moving the era commits a new date, the new date re-spells the text, and the text-to-value
effect re-derived a date from those digits and the signal — which had not caught up — committing the old era
back. Duplicated state plus two effects is a loop.

### `TextField` takes a mask transform, not a pattern

Changed, when the grouped number became the third consumer.
`computeMaskedText(previous, next, caret)` replaces `getMask`: a pattern mask and a grouped number are the same
function with a different body, and a grouped number has no pattern to state because it has as many separators
as its value needs. The transform stays where `getMask` was — inside `TextSync.createValueSync` — because _"a
mask owns the caret"_ is unchanged.

### `TextSyncUtils` is public, so the mask is a contract rather than an implementation

Settled by the user, choosing to export it over leaving it internal. `TextSync.utils` now leaves through
`index.ts` beside `TextSync` itself: `applyMask`, `applyGroupedMask`, `getGroupSizes`, the two `formatWith*`
helpers, the digit readers and both types.

**The argument that decided it is what a consumer is left with otherwise.** Three fields in this library are
built on it and a fourth kind — a phone number, a card number, a postcode — is an ordinary thing to want. A
consumer who cannot reach the mask reaches for a package instead, and the caret arithmetic is the part that
is hard to get right and easy to get subtly wrong: which digit a backspace over a separator takes, where the
caret lands when the groups shift under it. Withholding it does not stop that field being built; it only
stops it being built on the answer already tested here.

**What that commits to, stated so the next change to it is a deliberate one.** The caret rules are now
observable behaviour: where the caret lands after an insertion, a deletion or a paste is part of the
contract, not an internal detail. So is the mask vocabulary — `#` as the digit slot, a minus as the only
sign, group sizes read from the decimal point outwards. Changing any of those is a change a consumer can
see, and belongs in the same class as changing a prop's meaning.

**Nothing is annotated on the way out.** A utility's contract here is its signature, which is the rule for
this repo rather than for `ss-utils`; exporting it does not change that, and the entry above is where the
reasoning lives.

### Controls: `CurrencyInput`, and why it is not `NumberInput` with grouping

Settled by the user, choosing a separate control over widening `NumberInput`.

**The two fields are typed differently, not styled differently.** `NumberInput` refuses characters one
keystroke at a time and keeps `-`, `1.`, `1e` and `1e-` typeable. `CurrencyInput` accepts digits only and
fills a fixed fraction from the right, so `1`, `2`, `3` walk `0.01`, `0.12`, `1.23`. Neither is a mode of the
other, and moving `NumberInput` onto the mask path to get grouping would have risked a shipped control for a
field it is not.

**The digits are the value in its smallest unit, and the shift is done on the decimal spelling.** Multiplying
rounds the wrong way at exactly the cases a money field exists for: `1.005 * 100` is `100.49999999999999`, so a
rounded product loses the penny and `toFixed` inherits the fault. `${value}` prints the shortest decimal that
reads back as the same number, so moving the point along that string rounds on what the consumer wrote rather
than on its binary approximation. A magnitude printing in exponential form falls back to multiplying; an amount
field is not where `1e21` belongs.

**The separators come from the locale, not from props**, and so does the grouping. `Intl.NumberFormat`
already knows both and the consumer has already said which locale they are in; asking twice invites the two to
disagree. The grouping used to be the exception — a `groupSize` prop defaulting to three, on the grounds that
how wide a group is is a layout choice rather than a locale fact. That reasoning was wrong in the one place it
mattered: `en-IN` writes `12,34,567`, three digits nearest the point and twos above it, so a field that took
that locale's comma and grouped in threes anyway was spelling the locale wrong in the very place it had been
told what the locale is. `TextSyncUtils.getGroupSizes` reads the answer out of `Intl` beside the separators,
and `groupSizes` is now an override rather than the source.

**The override is a list of sizes because a single number cannot say what a locale can.** A prop meant for a
consumer who wants something other than their locale's grouping would otherwise be strictly less expressive
than the default it replaces, which is the argument for the shape rather than any current call site.

**There is no sign and no currency symbol.** The mask is digits-only, so a negative amount cannot be typed;
the symbol is paint in a leading slot, because a library holding no colours does not hold currencies either.

### An era is named from year 2, not from its first day

Settled, from a defect that survived two wrong fixes. `getEras` needs a date to format each
era's name from, and the era's own first day is the one date that does not work: the package puts Meiji 1 at
1868-09-08 while ICU switches on the proclamation date weeks later, so formatting the first day reports the era
_before_ it and Meiji came out named "Keiō (1865–1868)". Year 2 is a full year clear of the boundary and works
whichever way an era counts — forward for Meiji, backward for BC, where year 2 is earlier.

**Every instant handed to `Intl` is taken at midday.** A `CalendarDate` becomes an instant at local midnight,
and midnight is the one moment that does not survive the trip: a daylight-saving change can put it on the
previous day, and a pre-standard-time zone offset is not even a whole number of minutes. The pre-package
`DateValue` did this, it was dropped in the rewrite, and it is back.

**An era carries a long name and a short one.** `DateValueEra` is `{ id, name, shortName }`: the identifier is
the package's and is not display text — `BC`, `meiji`, `before_minguo`, with no casing convention and an
underscore in one — while both names come from `Intl` and are the locale's. A compact control shows `shortName`
and labels itself with `name`. Nothing may render `id`.

### A list the consumer has not finished handing over: `getHasMoreOptions`, `onReachEnd`, and a marker

Settled, after the published virtualization design was tried and reverted (`backlog.md` item
5). This is the other half of the same problem with a different answer, so both are worth stating together:
**virtualization keeps the whole list and mounts a window onto it; this keeps only what has arrived and mounts
all of it.**

**`Select` takes `getHasMoreOptions` and `onReachEnd`, and never a batch size.** A batch size would put the
library in charge of slicing the consumer's data, and the floor a batch size wants — "at least as many as fit"
— is not computable here anyway: the element that scrolls is the **consumer's** popup surface, since the
`max-height` and `overflow-y` live in their paint, and `Select` holds no ref to it. So the library reports an
event and reads a flag; the consumer decides what a batch is, where it comes from, and when there is no more.
An in-memory array sliced by the consumer and a paged HTTP endpoint become the same mechanism.

**The end is marked by a one-pixel element and watched with an intersection observer, not measured.** The
alternative — a `scroll` listener comparing `scrollTop + clientHeight` against `scrollHeight` — loses on three
counts: it needs the scrolling element, which is the consumer's; it needs a "how close counts" threshold,
which is wrong for some row height; and it is silent when the first batch does not fill the box, because
nothing has scrolled. `ElementObserver.createViewportIntersectionObserver` observes against the viewport, and
an observer computes intersection through every ancestor's overflow clip, so it reports the marker hidden
without being told what is hiding it. "The list is too short to scroll" and "you have scrolled to the bottom"
become the same condition, which is what makes it converge with no startup path.

**The marker overlaps the last option rather than following it, and the keyboard is the reason.** A negative
top margin equal to its own height puts it on the last pixel _of_ the list instead of the first pixel _after_
it, so it costs no layout. It shipped as a plain trailing element, which does not work for
anyone not using a mouse: an option scrolls itself into view with `block: "nearest"`, which stops the moment
that option is fully visible, so a marker beyond the last option is exactly what `End` and the last
`ArrowDown` can never reveal — the highlight lands on the last option held and no batch is ever asked for.
Overlapping makes "the last option is on screen" and "the marker is on screen" the same fact, and the mouse
path is unchanged.

Why the suite missed it: at a scale of exactly 1 the marker's top edge lands on the scroll box's bottom edge to
the pixel, and Chrome reports that zero-area contact as an intersection, so the batch arrives and the spec
passes. The Playground is scaled by `Viewport` and is almost never at 1, and at any other scale the contact
misses by a fraction. **A behaviour that depends on two edges being equal is not a behaviour**, so the spec now
asserts the overlap itself rather than the batch that follows.

**The Playground does not skip painting off-screen options, because it moves the list under the reader.** The
option paint carried `content-visibility: auto` with an estimated row height behind a panel switch. The
estimate is a single number and the rows are not one height — a title alone is short, a title with a wrapped
description is not — so the moment a jump to the end forces the skipped rows to be laid out for real, every
height above the highlight is corrected at once and the scroll offset no longer points where it did. `End` then
leaves the highlighted option below the visible box. The user removed the switch. What it
bought was the cost of _painting_ options, which is a different and smaller cost than _mounting_ them;
`backlog.md` item 3 holds what is left.

**The marker is keyed on the options array, and that is load-bearing.** An intersection observer reports only
_changes_, so a batch too small to push the marker off screen would deliver no callback and the list would
stall. Rebuilding the marker whenever the array identity changes forces a fresh observation of fresh geometry;
`createViewportIntersectionObserver` sets its flag back to `false` on every re-registration for the same
reason, so the answer is never carried over from an element that no longer exists. Reading the flag
synchronously after a batch arrives — what the earlier attempt did — fetched one batch more than it needed
every time.

**The guard holds the options array itself, not its length, and it is a plain variable rather than a signal.**
Nothing renders from it. Its job is to stop a marker that leaves and re-enters while a request is in flight
from asking twice for the same list, and the array's identity is exactly what "the same list" means. Length is
not: a **filtered** list is replaced rather than appended to, so a new query whose result happens to be as long
as the last would be read as already asked and the list would never load. Reachable the moment autocomplete
and batches are combined, which the Playground now demonstrates. The guard clears when the popup closes.

**Filtering and batching compose without either knowing about the other.** The query is the consumer's, the
batches are the consumer's, and the library only reports that the end of what it holds is on screen. A
consumer wanting the server to filter runs a new search on a query change and replaces the array; `onReachEnd`
then pages within that query. Note that `Home` and `End` are already suppressed on a filterable field, so the
wrap rule below is the only keyboard behaviour applying to a fetched autocomplete.

**An incomplete list does not wrap, and that is `Select`'s call rather than `NavigatorUtils`'s.** The 1D walk
still answers _which position is next_ and still wraps; `Select` answers _whether to go there_, and refuses
when the step would carry off either end while more options exist. No option was added to
`computeNextPosition`, because three of its four callers are closed rings and would gain a mode they can never
use. `Home` and `End` needed no change — they resolve against the array the library was handed, which is
exactly "the first and last held".

**What this does not do is make a complete list cheap.** A consumer holding 100,000 options in memory and
slicing them gets a list that opens quickly and grows as it is read, at the cost of `End` meaning "the last one
loaded" — the library declining to know something it knows. The user took that trade for the
incomplete case, which is the case this is built for.

### A list too long to mount: `computeEstimatedOptionHeight` and `Abstracts/Virtualizer`

Settled, on the second attempt. **On-demand loading answers a list that has not all arrived;
this answers a list that has all arrived and is too long to build.** They compose, and neither knows about the
other.

**Passing an estimated height is what turns it on, and a list short enough not to need it should not pass
one.** The user's rule: under a couple of hundred options there is nothing to win, and the cost is real — a
windowed list is placed from measurements that arrive late, so it accepts imprecision to buy back time that was
never being spent. No boolean and no automatic threshold, because a threshold would be the library guessing at
a row height it has never seen.

**The estimate belongs to the consumer because the height is a consequence of `renderOption`.** It is per index
rather than one number, so rows in two known shapes can be answered separately. It is consulted only for rows
nobody can see — every row on screen is measured for real — so what it buys is an honest scrollbar before
anything has been scrolled. TanStack's advice is to estimate the **largest** plausible row so the guess errs
one way and the list only ever settles upward.

**`@tanstack/solid-virtual` is a runtime dependency, marked external rather than bundled.** The first attempt
took a package out again; this one keeps it, on the user's call that a dependency is acceptable
for exactly this kind of functionality — the call `colorthief` already carries. External rather than bundled
follows `colorthief` too: a package both inlined into `dist` and declared in `dependencies` makes a consumer
install a copy they never load. `@internationalized/date` is still bundled while being declared, the older half
of that inconsistency, and has not been argued.

**The windower lives inside `Select`, and that is the whole difference from the attempt that failed.** The
design had the **consumer** window the list and hand over only the visible slice, so `Select` walked
the slice: `Home`, `End` and the arrows were confined to whatever happened to be mounted. Holding the whole
array and mounting a window onto it leaves `getFlatOptions`, the navigable set and the whole keyboard model
untouched — only what is in the document changes.

**A grouped list is not windowed, and that is a boundary rather than a preference.** A group's box wraps the
options inside it, so a window opening halfway down one would have to draw a box for a group whose header is
above the window and whose end is below it, and repeat the header as the reader scrolls. Passing an estimate
for a list containing a group mounts everything, silently and correctly.

**Row heights are taken as fractions, which is one line of the package's default replaced.** TanStack's own
`measureElement` rounds the observed border box to a whole pixel. A row is rarely a whole number of pixels
tall — a two-line option here measures 97.5 — so every rounded row gives its slot half a pixel the row does
not fill, and consecutive rows sit with a hairline between them: invisible against an unpainted row, obvious
the moment a consumer gives their options a background. The override returns the unrounded `blockSize` when a
`ResizeObserver` entry is present and delegates to the package's own function otherwise, so every fallback
path — the cache lookup, the estimate, the synchronous first measure — behaves exactly as before. The
observed box is in layout pixels, so this is also the one measurement `Viewport`'s scale cannot distort.

**Four things the package's documentation does not cover, all from one root: this library is a guest inside
somebody else's popup.**

- **Solid runs a `ref` while the element is still being built.** The measurer identifies a row by reading an
  index attribute off the node it is handed, and at `ref` time the attribute is not on it and the node is not
  in the document — so measuring from the `ref` reads an unnamed, unlaid-out element and silently keeps the
  estimate. Rows then tile on the estimate rather than their real heights, and a row taller than its slot
  paints over the one below. The index is written onto the element and the measurement deferred to mount.
  React's adapter never meets this because React runs refs after commit; nothing warns about it.
- **The rows' container does not start where the scrolling starts.** Row offsets are measured from the top of
  the container the library owns, a scroll position from the top of whatever is scrolling, and between them
  sits however much border and padding the consumer put on their popup. Unset, every scroll target lands short
  by that inset, which reads as an arrow key stopping one option early. `scrollMargin` is the package's own
  answer; the offset has to be worked out in layout space rather than off raw client rects, because `Viewport`
  scales the page.
- **A highlighted row must be mounted whether or not it is in view.** `aria-activedescendant` names an element
  by id, and scrolling to a row is not the same instant as mounting it, so the name refers to nothing until the
  window catches up. The row carrying the highlight is pinned into the range.
- **An option can no longer scroll itself into view**, because until the window reaches it there is nothing to
  scroll. The move belongs to whatever owns the window, and it hangs off the highlight as an effect rather than
  off the key handler, so a highlight arriving any other way is carried the same way.

**What it is worth, measured on the Playground's stress card at 10,000 options**: 792 ms from click to the
first painted frame with every option mounted, against 71 ms with a window of four. Frame rate while open was
never the problem and is unchanged. The remaining cost at open is linear but has no DOM in it — building the
records, flattening them, finding the navigable ones — and that is the floor a windower cannot lower.

### Controls: `Tree`, and the group box that could not be a child

`Tree` is `role="tree"` with expand and collapse, one selected value, and a keyboard
where the two axes mean different things. Most of it is `Select`'s model applied a second time; the parts that
are not are here.

**A node is one record with optional children, and a branch is a node that has at least one — or one that
says it will.** `TreeNode<T>` carries `value`, `children`, and the same `isDisabled` /
`isReachableWhenDisabled` / `tooltipDefs` trio every other item record carries. `TreeUtils.getIsBranch` was
`(node.children?.length ?? 0) > 0`, `Menu`'s test for a submenu character for character; it is now that **or**
`hasMoreChildren`. See the next section for why the second field turned out not to be the contradiction this
entry once predicted.

**Render from the nesting, walk the flat order.** `TreeUtils.getVisibleRows` takes the nodes and a predicate
and returns a rendering tree with collapsed branches already removed; `getFlatRows` collapses that into walking
order. Same split as `SelectUtils.getFlatOptions`, for the same reason: the arrows, the edge keys and the
roving tab stop index into the flat list and never learn that nesting happened. Each row carries its own flat
`index`, so the two views agree without anything being kept in step.

**The `role="group"` box is a sibling of the branch's row, not its child, and that is forced rather than
preferred.** The published markup puts the group inside the `treeitem` it belongs to. Here every row is an
`InteractionWrapper`, which listens for `mouseenter`, `mousedown` and `keydown` on the element it was handed —
all three of which reach an ancestor. A row nested inside another row would report its ancestor as hovered
while the pointer was over the child, and as pressed while the child was being clicked. Fixing that means
teaching `wrapElement` that a descendant's hover is not its own, which is false for every other control, where
the descendants are the painter's own markup.

So the groups nest but the rows do not. Depth still computes correctly from the markup — one group per level —
and `aria-level`, `aria-posinset` and `aria-setsize` are written on every row as well, which the published
pattern asks for whenever the DOM is not the whole hierarchy. The one thing given up is the formal ownership of
a group by the `treeitem` above it; `aria-owns` would restore it on paper and was rejected for the reason
recorded under the presentational wrapper.

**A roving tab stop, not `aria-activedescendant`, because there is no second element to put it on.** `Select`
can name its highlighted option from the combobox because the combobox is a separate, always-present element
holding real focus. A tree has only its rows, so the focused row is the focused element and the tab order has
to be roving — `Tabs`' arrangement, down to the roving position falling back to the selection and then to the
first navigable row.

**Focus moves by id rather than through a ref array, because a tree's indexes move under it.** `Tabs` and
`Accordion` keep an array of refs indexed by position, which works because their lists are flat and fixed.
Expanding a branch renumbers every row below it while the elements stay put, and a `ref` callback does not run
again to say so — so an array keyed by index would silently point at the wrong rows. Each row carries
`${treeId}-node-${index}` as its id and moving focus is a `getElementById`. The same id tells the key handler
which row is focused, which is how a click and an arrow key end up on the same footing.

**The focus rescue on a collapse is a guard over the visible rows, not a step inside `collapse`.** Corrected
. It began as a check inside `collapse` — is focus on a descendant, and if so move it to the
branch — and that check could never be true: `ArrowLeft` and a click both act on the branch, which is already
focused and stays mounted. The case it was written for is a **consumer** writing `expandedSignal` themselves,
the only way a focused row can vanish, and which never enters `collapse`. So the guard watches the visible
rows: it remembers the last row focused inside this tree from a `focusin` on the root, and when a collapse
leaves that row out of the visible set **and** focus has fallen to the document body, it moves focus to the
branch that closed.

All three conditions carry weight. Without the remembered row, a tree nobody has touched would steal focus
whenever a consumer collapsed anything. Without checking that the row actually left, a collapse elsewhere in
the tree would do the same. And without focus genuinely sitting on the body, the guard would fight a consumer
who moved focus on purpose — which is why a button that collapses on the spot cannot exercise it: the button
holds focus, so there is nothing to rescue.

**One press both selects and toggles, because the library paints no twisty.** A consumer draws the branch
marker inside `renderNode`, so the component cannot tell a press on the marker from a press on the label — and
if a press did not toggle, a mouse user could not open a branch at all. `Enter` and `Space` do exactly what a
click does. A consumer wanting "the chevron opens, the label selects" has no route to it; see `backlog.md`.

**A disabled node is not a disabled subtree.** The arrows skip it and nothing selects or opens it, but its
children stay navigable if it was already open. A disabled branch is a statement about that node; a consumer
who means the whole subtree disables the nodes in it.

**A collapsed branch's children are not built**, the opposite of `Accordion`, because nothing needs measuring:
an accordion panel animates to a height it can only learn by building the content, while a tree's rows just
appear.

**Not windowed, and it is the same boundary a grouped `Select` hits.** A window opening halfway down a subtree
would have to draw a `role="group"` whose start is above the window and whose end is below it. The flat walking
order is exactly what a windower wants and the row records already carry it, so the missing half is the markup
rather than the arithmetic.

**The walk wraps, as every other list in this library does.** The published tree pattern stops at the ends.
Wrapping is what `Select`, `Menu`, `Tabs` and `RadioGroup` all do through `computeNextPosition`, and a tree
that stopped would be the one list here behaving differently — consistency inside the library won over the
published behaviour, recorded here rather than being discoverable only by pressing `ArrowUp` on the first row.

### A branch whose children have not arrived: `hasMoreChildren`, and where the waiting is painted

The gap this closes was recorded as hard for two reasons, and only one of them survived contact.

**The field cannot contradict the children, because it can only add.** The objection on record was that the
fix would be "a second field whose only job is to contradict the first" — which is what `isBranch?: boolean`
would have been, since `isBranch: false` on a node with children is a state the component would have to pick a
winner for. `hasMoreChildren` is the other shape: `getIsBranch` is `children.length > 0 || hasMoreChildren`, so
setting it on a node that already has children changes nothing and there is no disagreement to resolve. The
name is `Select`'s — `getHasMoreOptions` says the same thing about a list, and this says it about a node's
children, so a consumer meeting the second has already met the first.

**Nothing new tells the consumer to fetch, and that is deliberate.** No `loadChildren` prop and no
`onExpandBranch`. Opening a branch writes its value into `expandedSignal`, which is the **consumer's** signal —
they already see every expansion, so a callback would report a change they were handed anyway. Ark UI takes
`loadChildren` plus `onLoadChildrenComplete` and React Aria has a loading item, but both of those own the list;
here the nodes are a prop, so the arrival is a new `nodes` value and nothing else. The library reports and the
consumer decides, which is the same split `getHasMoreOptions` / `onReachEnd` took for `Select`.

**Where "loading" is painted was the half this was blocked on, and the answer is a render prop into the box the
library owns.** `renderPendingChildren` is called for a branch that is expanded and has no rows, and it is
given the branch's node and **the depth its children would have had** — without that second argument a consumer
cannot line the placeholder up with the rows it stands in for, since the indent is theirs to draw. It is
optional, and a tree that does not pass it renders no group box at all rather than an empty one.

**A branch reports `aria-busy`, not a fabricated child row.** `aria-busy` is global, so it is valid on a
`treeitem`, and it says exactly what is true: this element's contents are being updated. The alternative was a
placeholder row carrying `role="treeitem"`, React Aria's shape — rejected because a row that is not a node
would have to be given an `aria-posinset` and an `aria-setsize` it does not have, and would land in the
walking order the arrows and typeahead use. **The consequence to know:** a consumer who sets `hasMoreChildren`
and never delivers leaves a branch permanently busy. That is the consumer stating something untrue rather than
something for the library to time out.

**It works in a windowed tree, which took one extra placement rather than a second design.** A windowed tree
emits no `role="group"` boxes at all, so the placeholder is rendered inside the branch row's own positioned box
instead, after the row. The virtualizer measures each row rather than trusting the estimate, so a row that grows
by a placeholder is measured at its new height and the ones below it move down. `isPending` is on
`TreeNodeFlags` besides, so a painter can put a spinner on the twisty itself in either rendering.

### A windowed `Tree` is flat, and that is the opposite of a windowed `Select`

**`computeEstimatedNodeHeight` opts a tree into windowing**, over the flat walking order `TreeUtils.getFlatRows`
already produced for the keyboard. Both renderings share one `renderRow`, so a windowed tree and a mounted one
differ only in what wraps the rows.

**The windowed rendering emits no `role="group"` at all.** This is the reverse of the grouped `Select`
decision recorded above, and the difference is worth holding onto. A `Select` group box is a sibling of
nothing — it carries the group's name on `aria-label`, so a box around part of a group is still a correct,
named box. A tree's group box means something only as the child of the treeitem that owns it; a box for a
subtree whose parent is outside the window would be **detached** rather than partial, which is worse than
having none. The published pattern answers this case directly: when the nodes are not all in the DOM because
the reader is scrolling, every node states `aria-level`, `aria-posinset` and `aria-setsize`. Every treeitem
here already did, for the keyboard's sake, so windowing needed no new attribute.

**The roving row is pinned, and focus scrolls before it moves.** `focusRow` asks the window to bring the row
in before calling `focus`, and the roving row is in `getPinnedRows` so it stays mounted once reached —
otherwise arrowing to a row outside the window would call `focus` on an element that does not exist and
silently drop focus to the body.

### `Tree` nodes can be links, on `Tab<T>`'s terms

Added, at the user's request, after the left menu was weighed as a tree. A hierarchical menu is
the obvious use for a tree and the rows were `div`s: a consumer could route from `onSelectionChange`, but the
entries would not have been links — no middle-click, no open-in-new-tab, no copy-link-address, no destination
in the status bar. None of that is reachable from a click handler.

**`href` is a field on the node and it chooses the element**, exactly as `Tab<T>`'s does. A row with one
renders an `<a role="treeitem">` through `Dynamic`, a row without one stays a `div`, and both take the same
`commonProps` object of getters so the ARIA cannot drift. `TreeProps` also takes a `linkComponent`, for the
reason `Tabs` takes one: an `<a>` reloads the application.

**`TreeLinkProps` is declared in `Tree.types.ts` rather than imported from `Tabs.types.ts`.** The two are the
same shape today, but they are two components' public prop types, and importing one control's type into
another's surface would mean a consumer of `Tree` reading `Tabs`' documentation, and would make a future
divergence a breaking change for the wrong component.

**Keyboard: a link row hands its activation to the element.** `Enter` is left alone, because an anchor fires
its own click from `Enter` and that click already runs the row's activation — so selecting, toggling and
navigating happen through one path, and calling `preventDefault` would have selected the row while refusing to
go anywhere. `Space` is the case an anchor does not answer: the row cancels the page scroll and clicks the
element itself, so the two keys stay interchangeable.

**A disabled link row cancels the navigation rather than just skipping the callback.** The click handler calls
`preventDefault` before returning, which is `TabsItem`'s arrangement and is not optional here: on a `div` an
early return is enough, while an anchor would have followed its `href` regardless.

### Controls: `SlideButton`, and why the gesture is the only thing it owns

Settled, when the user named a slide-to-activate control as a gap. It is a `Button` whose
activation is a drag from one end of a track to the other, for the case where an accidental press would be
expensive — send, arm, delete.

**It is a real `<button>`, and it does not listen for a click.** Listening for `click` would defeat the
control, because a press and a release is a click whether or not anything slid — a tap would activate, and so
would a slide dragged back and abandoned. So the element carries the button's semantics and its name, and every
activation route is written by hand.

**There are two routes, and neither is a tap: drag the thumb to the end, or hold a press until it fills.** The
hold drives the same `progressRatio`, so the paint is identical and a person who cannot drag sees what a person
who drags sees. It answers three things at once:

- **WCAG 2.2's 2.5.7 Dragging Movements**, Level AA: _"All functionality that uses a dragging movement for
  operation can be achieved by a single pointer without dragging, unless dragging is essential."_ A keyboard
  route does not satisfy it — 2.5.7 is about **pointers** — so a mouse or touch user who cannot drag needed
  their own route. The published list of conforming alternatives names long press explicitly, and it is the
  only entry that does not throw away the deliberateness the control exists for.
- **WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard**, answered by the same hold starting on `Enter` or `Space` held down. A tap of either
  does nothing.
- **The reason the control exists.** A stray `Enter` on a focused button is the keyboard's version of the
  accidental press a slide resists.

What does **not** bite, though it looks as though it should: **2.5.1 Pointer Gestures** is about path-based
gestures, and its Understanding document is explicit that a slider using pointer capture — which is what
`trackDrag` does — counts as dragging only. So the drag route is on the right side of 2.5.1 by construction.

**Apple's own answer is the shape of this, arrived at from the other end.** Asked whether a swipe-to-confirm
harms VoiceOver users, Apple's guidance is to override `accessibilityActivate` so a single activation runs the
same logic **without** the swipe; the iOS lock screen behaves that way. What is built here is that answer with
the timing put back in — the part their platform gets from the assistive technology's own confirmation step and
a web control does not.

**What a screen reader is told is the field's hint, said once, and the library invents no words.** A person
who cannot see the fill hears the button's name and then nothing — so the gap was never a running commentary
on the bar, it was not being told what the control wants before starting. `SlideButton` reads the `FormField`
description context like every input does, so wrapping it in a field with "hold or slide to send" makes that
the button's description, read after its name when it takes focus. Nothing is announced during the gesture:
speech inside a one-second hold is the stutter `LiveAnnouncer` exists to avoid, and it would still be talking
when the action fired.

**Why that is the whole of what is owed here, rather than a compromise.** The gesture exists to resist an
_accidental_ activation, and a screen reader already supplies that protection by construction: reaching a
control and then activating it are two separate deliberate acts, which is not the case for a stray click or a
misplaced tap. Apple's guidance for the pattern says the same thing from the other end — collapse the swipe to
a single activation for VoiceOver — and the iOS lock screen does exactly that. So the assistive route wants
_less_ gesture, not a described one, and a consumer who agrees already has the switch: `getHoldDurationMs` of
`0` makes the first frame complete the hold, so a plain press activates. The library cannot make that choice
itself, because detecting a screen reader is neither possible nor something to attempt.

**The progress is a flag and a signal, and the signal is optional.** `progressSignal` is the ratio the fill
is drawn from, taken through `SignalMirror.createOptional` exactly as a popup's `visibilitySignal` is: with no
prop the control keeps the number to itself, and with one the consumer holds the same variable the painter
reads. It exists because a flag only reaches `renderContent` — a readout beside the control, a second control
that reacts half-way, or a warning that appears at eighty per cent is outside that slot and had no route to
the number at all. A consumer write lands, and the next frame of a hold or a drag overwrites it, which is the
same bargain `Select` makes when it writes `false` back into a visibility signal it did not open.

**A press on the thumb starts both, and movement decides which.** A hold begins on every press; a press that
landed on the thumb converts to a drag once the pointer travels past a few pixels, and the abandoned hold snaps
back at that moment. Pressing the thumb and holding still therefore confirms, which matters because the thumb
is the obvious thing to press and a dead zone there would fail exactly the people 2.5.7 is for. The travel
threshold is a jitter guard rather than a tuned value and is a module constant; if it ever needs to move it
should become a prop.

**The press must land on the thumb for a drag.** `trackDrag` reports from `pointerdown` onward, which is what a
slider wants — press the track and the value jumps there — and is exactly wrong here, since pressing at 90% and
nudging right would be the shortcut the control exists to prevent. The first report of each drag is hit-tested
against the thumb's current span, and a drag that did not begin on the thumb is ignored for its whole length
rather than cancelled part-way. The grab offset inside the thumb is kept and subtracted from every later report,
so the thumb does not jump under the pointer.

**The thumb's size is the library's to know and the painter's to draw, which is `Range`'s cost paid again.**
`getThumbSize` feeds the hit test and the painter positions its own thumb with
`calc(ratio * (100% - thumbSize))`; nothing enforces agreement, and the Playground keeps them honest with one
shared `SLIDE_BUTTON_THUMB_SIZE`. Handing the size out through the flags was dropped for consistency with
`Range`, which had the choice first.

**The track is measured with `clientWidth` rather than `getBoundingClientRect`.** The thumb size arrives in
plain CSS pixels, so the width it is divided by has to be in the same space; a client rect carries a
`Viewport`'s scale baked in. The same hazard the drag ratio avoids by being a fraction of two same-space
measurements — but the thumb size is not one of those measurements, so it has to be handled rather than divided
out.

**Releasing is what activates a drag, and releasing short of the end cancels the gesture.** Firing the moment
the thumb touches the end takes away the ability to change your mind mid-slide, which is worth more here than
the earlier feedback. **A hold is the other way round**: it fires the moment it fills, because there is nothing
to change your mind about once the bar is full and waiting for a release would leave a completed hold looking
broken.

**`getHoldDurationMs` defaults to 1000 and is a prop because it is a tuned value.** Long enough to be
deliberate, short enough not to feel stuck; nobody has measured it, and a consumer with a heavier consequence
should be able to set it without forking the control.

**The control returns to rest on release, always, including after a successful slide.** A slide is a way of
pressing a button, and a button is not still pressed while the consumer's handler runs; anything outliving the
gesture — in flight, succeeded, failed — is the consumer's state, exactly as for `Button`. A consumer wanting
the thumb to stay at the end already has the route without a new prop: pass `getIsPressed`, and the painter
reads `isPressed` and draws the thumb at 1. The Playground's second variant is that composition, so the
omission is not re-derived as a gap.

**A drag does not focus the control, a departure from a native button and the lesser evil.** `trackDrag` calls
`preventDefault` on `pointerdown` — it must, or the press starts a text selection — and that suppresses the
compatibility `mousedown` whose default action is the focus. Calling `focus()` back was tried and reverted the
same day: a scripted focus is not a pointer focus as far as the engine is concerned, so `:focus-visible`
matched and every mouse drag drew the ring. `ColorArea` does call `focus()` and should keep doing so — its axis
sliders are useless unless the arrow keys reach them — while here there is nothing focus enables that the drag
has not already done.

**`isDragging` and `isHolding` are two flags rather than one, and a painter almost always wants both.** They
are separate facts — one is a pointer carrying the thumb, the other a press filling it — and a painter that
wants to say "keep holding" needs to tell them apart. The Playground's painter takes the union and calls it
tracking, which is the common case: while either is true the value is being driven live and a CSS transition
would lag a frame behind.

**`isDragging` means the thumb is being dragged, not that a pointer is down.** `trackDrag`'s own signal turns
on for a press anywhere on the track, including one the hit test refused, so the flag a painter reads is that
signal and a live grab together. A painter keyed on the raw one would drop its transition on a press that moves
nothing.

### The Playground: an example's source is a folder view, and a sample is a file

Settled with the user. `PageComponents/Examples` exists to put a source-code button next to a
demo, and what that button showed was always incomplete: an example imports its samples, its styled components
and its page's own types, and only the example's own text was displayed — the half that was already obvious.

**What is shown is a set of tabs, and a tab is a folder rather than a file.** One tab for the example itself,
then one per thing it imports; inside a tab, an `Accordion` with the imported file open and its `.css.ts` and
`.types.ts` siblings collapsed beside it. The sections are whichever of those files exist — four of the 37
`StyledComponents` folders are missing one of the two, and "the files that are there" costs nothing and never
needs a special case.

**A tab is not every file in the folder**, the version that looks simpler and is wrong: a page folder would
drag in a 600-line props panel. It is the file that was imported, plus its style and types siblings.

**Only `playground/src` imports become tabs; everything from `components/src` stays opaque.** The line is what the
consumer has to write: the Playground half is theirs to reproduce, the library half is already written for
them. `@thewaver/ss-utils` and `solid-js` are on the library side for the same reason.

**Depth stops where the code stops being consumer-shaped.** Tabs follow imports transitively through
`StyledComponents`, and one level everywhere else. Not arbitrary: _"The three trees"_ defines
`PageComponents` as what the Playground would still need if the library did not exist, which is exactly the code
nobody copies. Following everything would put `Theme.css` on every example in the app.

**A page's own types and stylesheet are behind a flag, defaulting on.** An example importing `ShapePage.types`
is importing the shared prop type that lets one props panel drive seven examples — real, and not something a
consumer would write. Whether it belongs in the tab list was a hard call, so the mechanism resolves it like any
other folder and one constant decides whether it survives, in the shape `SHOW_COMPOSITES` uses in `App.tsx`.
**The default is not the user's call, it is this file's** — on, so the path stays exercised and the question
gets answered by looking at a real page.

### Samples: one file per key, and the key is the file's name

The same decision from the other end, and why `Samples/` had to be reorganised first.

**A sample is a file, and the registry is an index that imports them.** `SVGDefs.const.tsx` was 2534 lines
holding three registries; a tab showing it would have been useless whatever it cost to load. Splitting was
never about weight — the source is fetched on demand — but about a tab a person can read. That tab is gone now
that the samples ship from the library, and the split earns its keep on a second ground it did not have at the
time: one file is what a consumer can import on its own. See _"Samples live in the library"_.

**The key is the file's name, which is what lets a runtime selection find its source.** The example imports the
whole registry and indexes it with a key from the props panel, so nothing in its own imports says which sample
is showing. Rather than tracing that, the modal resolves the key to `<Registry>/<key>.ts` by name. Two
mechanisms that never have to know about each other: the example's imports give the general tabs, the current
key gives the sample tab. It also makes renaming a sample and renaming its file the same act.

**Keys collide across registries, so the samples sit one folder down per registry.** `plain` exists in both
`Pattern` and `Gradient`; `Samples/SVGDefs/Gradient/plain.tsx` keeps the name-is-the-key rule intact.

**Nothing is folded into a factory.** `circle("grid")` produced three of the pattern samples from one helper,
and a file whose whole content is that call teaches nobody anything — the reader still has to open a second
tab. Each sample is written out. The line, taken from what `Gradient` already did: the sample's own **shape** is
explicit, while small shared helpers that are not the point of any sample — a base colour, a diagonal offset —
stay shared and get a tab of their own when opened. The total line count goes up, deliberately.

**A registry is only split when a tab of it would be unreadable, which is not every registry.** The tab is
gone; the line it drew is kept, now read as "unreadable in one file". Which registries are split has not moved.
`CellAnimationZones` and `CellAnimationOrigins` are 71 and 31 lines of one-line entries, and splitting those
produces files shorter than their own import headers — the same emptiness that unfolding the pattern factories
avoided, from the other direction. They get a folder and keep their registry whole. The rule is the goal
restated: split until a tab reads, and stop. Split so far: `SVGDefs` (2534 lines), `CellAnimation` (600),
`CellAnimationWeights` (515). Left whole: `CellAnimationZones`, `CellAnimationOrigins`,
`CellAnimation/Breakpoints`, `ScanlineAnimation/Keyframes`, the largest at 123 lines.

**A Playground namespace may not share a name with a library one, and the source view is what makes that a
rule.** The keyframe helpers were `CellAnimationUtils`, which `Lib/Exotics` already exports for something else
entirely. Two namespaces of one name is legal and nothing imported both, so the collision cost nothing while the
code was only ever read in an editor that could tell you which was which. A tab is read **out of context**,
which is exactly the confusion a tab cannot resolve. The Playground one is now `CellAnimationKeyframeUtils`.

Two smaller rules fell out, both house style everywhere else and broken only in the files this split created.
**A `.utils.ts` exports a namespace**, like `InteractionTracker`, `TreeUtils` and `SelectUtils`; `SVGDefsUtils`
and `CellAnimationWeightUtils` were bare exports and are not any more. And **the folder path names the
namespace it exports** — the keyframes folder was `CellAnimation/` while exporting `CellAnimationKeyframes`.
Since the restructure the path carries it in two parts rather than one: `CellAnimation/Keyframes` exports
`CellAnimationKeyframes`, and the file inside still holds the whole name. See _"How Samples is laid out"_.

**What is not shipping, and why it looks as though it should.** `fromStops` and the 3×3 matrix maths beside it
turn a list of keyframe stops into the evaluation function `CellAnimation` asks for, so a consumer wanting
keyframes rather than a formula writes their own. That is real, and it is still not the library's: the
component's contract is already the smaller and more general thing — a function from timeline to result — and a
stop list with `at`, `depth` and origin keys is one **opinion about how to author** such a function. Shipping it
would freeze that opinion as API for a consumer nobody has met, which is the layer item 8 in `backlog.md`
plans. The matrix half is a different case: it needs only the language to work, which is the `ss-utils` test,
and that package has `Vec2d` and `Vec4d` but no matrix — noted as a candidate rather than moved, because one
consumer is a thin case for an export in another repo.

**Types move to `<Name>.types.ts`, and they stop being a namespace.** A sample file needs the config type and
the registry needs the sample files, which is a cycle, so the types have to come out. They cannot come out into
a namespace of the same name, because a `namespace` does not merge across ES modules and any file wanting both
would import one identifier twice. Plain exported type names are what the rest of the repo uses (see _"House style"_ in
`conventions.md`), and the namespace stays on the value side only.

### A sample registry and the machinery that runs it are separate modules

The rule: **a module a consumer imports for behaviour may not import the samples.** Machinery takes the sample
itself; the registry that maps a name to a sample is its own export in the `.const.ts`, and only code driven by
a runtime string — the Playground's dropdowns — touches it.

**Why file layout alone did not achieve this.** The samples were already one file each, and that made no
difference to what a consumer pays for: `CellAnimationWeights.const.ts` imported all sixty back into a
`Record<WeightType, WeightFn>` and `computeCellWeights` looked its entry up by a string. A bundler cannot know
which string arrives, so it keeps every entry — the lookup table, not the file count, is what defeats
tree-shaking. Splitting the registries was for the source-view tabs and remains justified on that ground alone.

**What moved.** `computeCellWeights` (with its private `normalizeWeights` / `makeWeightsUnique`) went to
`CellAnimationWeights.utils.ts` and now takes a `WeightFn`. `computeAnimation` went to
`CellAnimationKeyframes.utils.ts` and now takes a `CellAnimationFn`. Each `.const.ts` exports its registry as
`SAMPLE_WEIGHTS` / `SAMPLE_ANIMATIONS`, matching the `SAMPLE_CONFIGS` / `SAMPLE_LAYOUTS` / `SAMPLE_INDENTS`
names the other registries already used.

**The key-based call is kept, as a one-line forwarder in the registry module.** `CellAnimationWeights.computeCellWeights("lineRow", …)` still works and every Playground call site is unchanged. This is not two APIs
competing: the forwarder lives in the module that already costs the whole collection, so anyone paying for the
registry keeps the ergonomic call, and anyone who wants one sample imports the sample and the utils module.

**Measured, bundled with esbuild, minified / gzipped.** Weights: 19.4K / 6.0K for the registry path against
5.7K / 2.5K for one sample. Keyframes: 27.3K / 7.1K against 13.7K / 4.8K.

**Two shapes needed nothing.** `SVGDefs` was already correct — `SVGDefs.const.ts` holds only `SAMPLE_COLORS`
and the three `SAMPLE_CONFIGS` registries, no sample imports the registry, and every helper the samples use
(`SVGDefs.utils`, `SVGPatterns.const`, `SVGAnimations.const`, `SVGAnimationTracks.const`) is sample-free. The
registries left whole under the split rule — `CellAnimation/Zones`, `CellAnimation/Origins`,
`CellAnimation/Breakpoints`, `ScanlineAnimation/Keyframes`, `Formation/Layouts` and `Staircase/Indents` —
define their samples inline in the same file, so there is no lighter path to offer without
splitting them, which _"a registry is only split when a tab of it would be unreadable"_ already decided
against.

**A `namespace` compiles to one object, so it is opaque to tree-shaking.** This is why the utils modules are
the right home for machinery and the wrong home for a collection: everything in one is kept together. The
measurement above already includes each utils namespace whole.

### Controls: `Paginator`, where the arithmetic is the component

Built, at the user's request, from the `backlog.md` entry that had argued it out of the
"compositions" list: the visible page range, where the gaps fall and how many pages sit either side of the
current one is arithmetic, and arithmetic is the library's half of the contract.

**`PaginatorUtils.getEntries` is a pure function with its own unit tests, and the component is a thin wrapper
over it.** Same split as `TreeUtils.getVisibleRows` and `SelectUtils.getFlatOptions`. Sixteen cases cover both
ends, both knobs, a page beyond the end, and no pages at all.

**A gap carries the pages it stands for, rather than being a bare ellipsis.** `{ kind: "gap", from, to }`
against Ark UI's `{ type: "ellipsis" }`. The library has computed those numbers on its way to deciding a gap
belongs there, so throwing them away makes the consumer's painter unable to say anything true — a tooltip
reading "pages 5 to 19" is free here and impossible there.

**A gap that would hide one page is spelled as that page.** Replacing `4` with `…` saves no room and costs a
destination. Arithmetic rather than paint, so it belongs in the function.

**The window is exactly `2 × siblings + 1` wide, and the boundaries do not reserve a slot for an ellipsis that
would hide nothing.** MUI keeps a slot free next to each boundary, which is why its list at page 1 is a page
longer than the same call here. The wasted slot is only ever visible as an ellipsis standing between page 1 and
page 2.

**The gap is `aria-hidden`.** It is not a control, and the pages behind it cannot be reached by naming them, so
announcing "pages 5 to 19" tells a screen reader user about something they cannot act on. Ark UI hides its
ellipsis for the same reason.

**`computeHref` is a function, where `Tab<T>` has an `href` field, and the difference is who authors the
list.** A consumer writes their own tabs, so a field is reachable; here the library generates the entries, so a
field would have nowhere to come from. The consumer knows the address shape and the library knows the page
numbers.

**The page is one-way — `getPage` plus `onPageChange` — following `Tabs` rather than `Select`.** _"Signal tuples for two-way
state"_ in `conventions.md` takes the pair only where the component genuinely writes, and its recorded exception
is a value derived from a route with no setter to hand over. A page number is that value more often than not,
and pages that are links make it certain. A consumer who does hold a signal spends two props on it, the cheaper
direction to adapt.

**Every item is its own tab stop, with no roving.** `Accordion`'s position rather than `Tabs`': a tab list is
one control with several states, a paginator is a row of independent destinations. `aria-current="page"` marks
the one you are on.

**A step with nowhere to go is `aria-disabled` and carries no `href`.** The target is computed first and the
control is disabled when it equals the current page, so "previous on page one" needs no special case. Dropping
the address as well matters only for the link form, where an anchor would otherwise still be followable by
every route that is not a click.

**The painted number is `aria-hidden` and the name comes from `computePageLabel`.** Exactly `Calendar`'s day
cells: a painter drawing a bare digit gives a reader "7" with no idea what of. The default names are English,
and the compute hook is the escape from that rather than a locale the library pretends to know.

### Controls: `Table`, a grid rather than a table, and why the markup could not be `<table>`

Built at the user's request, off the `backlog.md` entry that had put it last. That entry named the scope and
the build kept to it exactly: **sorting, selection, column sizing, sticky headers and virtualization**, plus
the keyboard and ARIA layer without which none of the five is conformant. Nothing outside that list was
added — see the gaps at the foot of this entry.

**The five features are what a `Table` component is _for_, and the argument is worth stating once.** A
`<table>` gives the semantics free: the row and column relationships are in the elements, so a reader
announces "column 3 of 7, Price, row 12" without being told. It gives no behaviour, and its layout is
auto-computed, which resizing and pinning fight. A `display: grid` of divs is the mirror image: total layout
control, and no semantics at all — `role="table"`, `role="row"`, `role="columnheader"`, `aria-rowcount` and
`aria-colindex` all have to be written by hand and kept correct as rows come and go. **The component is the
thing that reconciles the two**, and that reconciliation, not any single feature, is the work.

**Divs won, because virtualization decides it.** A virtualized row is absolutely positioned inside a sizer of
the total height, and a `<tr>` cannot be. Two consequences follow and both are load-bearing. The row element
is _itself_ the positioned element — no wrapper between `rowgroup` and `row`, because `role="row"` must be a
child of `role="rowgroup"` and a positioned div in between would break the tree. And every index a reader
would otherwise count is published instead: `aria-rowcount` on the grid, `aria-rowindex` on each row,
`aria-colcount` and `aria-colindex` on each cell. **Fifty thousand rows with thirty in the document is the
case those attributes exist for**, and it is why they are not optional here the way they are in a small table.

**Column widths are one CSS variable and one grid template.** `TableUtils.getColumnTemplate` builds a
`grid-template-columns` string from the columns and the stored widths; the root carries it as a variable
through `assignInlineVars`, and the header row and every body row read it. So header and body cannot drift
apart — they are laid out by the same string — and a resize is one signal write rather than a sweep of cells.
A column with a stored or declared width is a fixed `px` track; one without is `minmax(min, 1fr)` or
`minmax(min, max)`. **The root sets no `overflow` of its own**, deliberately: a non-visible overflow on one
axis forces the other, so `overflow-x` on the root would make the root the scroll parent and take both the
sticky header and the `Virtualizer`'s scroll element away from the consumer's own scrolling box.

**The header is a sticky rowgroup, which is why the consumer's box has to be the thing that scrolls.** Sticky
resolves against the nearest scrolling ancestor, and `Virtualizer.createScrollParent` walks up looking for the
same element, so both land on the consumer's container and stay in step. A consumer wanting horizontal scroll
puts it on that same box; scrolling both ways in one element is the arrangement everything here is built for.

**One tab stop for the whole grid, and the header row is row zero of the walk.** This is what separates a grid
from a list of focusable cells: sixty cells in the tab order would take sixty presses of Tab to pass. The
roving cell is a `{ x, y }` signal, clamped against the current column and row counts by a memo rather than
written back — so a table whose rows shrink under it still has exactly one tabbable cell and never traps a
reader outside the grid. `NavigatorUtils.computeNextCell` already carried the arithmetic, including the carry
at a row's end and the page keys, so no second implementation was written.

**Putting the header in the walk is what makes sorting reachable without a mouse.** The `columnheader` is
itself the control — `aria-sort` on the cell, Enter or Space to cycle it — rather than a `<button>` inside the
cell, because a button inside would be a second tab stop in a pattern whose whole point is having one. This is
the ARIA data-grid arrangement rather than the sortable-table one, and the two differ precisely on that.

**Sorting cycles ascending, descending, then off.** Three states rather than two: without the third, the order
the rows arrived in is unreachable once anything has been sorted, and that order is often the meaningful one.
`TableUtils.getNextSort` is pure and tested.

**Whether the table sorts is decided by the comparator, not by a mode prop.** A column with `compare` is
sorted by the component; a column marked `isSortable` without one has its sort _reported_ through
`sortSignal` and `onSortChange` and its rows left alone, which is the server-side case. The alternative —
an `isServerSorted` switch — puts the same fact in two places and lets them disagree. `getSortedRows` returns
**the very same array** when there is nothing to do, so an unsorted table hands no new reference downstream.

**Selection lives on the row and is painted by the cells.** `aria-selected` goes on `role="row"`, because a
row is the thing being picked; the cells only show it, which is why `isSelected` is on the cell flags. Space
toggles the focused row, Shift with an arrow extends from the anchor, Ctrl or Cmd with a click toggles one,
Shift with a click extends, and Ctrl-A takes everything. The anchor is a plain `let` rather than a signal —
nothing paints from it.

**One component for both selection modes, where `Select` and `MultiSelect` are two.** The split there exists
because the _trigger_ paints differently — one option against a row of chips — so `renderContent` has a
different signature in each. A table row's paint does not change with the mode; only which rows carry
`aria-selected` changes. So `selectionMode` is a prop, defaulting to `"multiple"` when a `selectionSignal` is
given and `"none"` when it is not — the presence of the signal is what turns selection on, so a consumer
cannot hand over a selection and silently get nothing.

**Resizing is pointer-dragged on a handle and keyboard-driven from the cell, and the handle is
`aria-hidden`.** A focusable handle would be the second tab stop the pattern cannot have, so the handle is a
pointer affordance and `Ctrl` with the left and right arrows on the focused header cell is its keyboard
equal — 2.1.1 is met without the tab order growing by one per column. The handle takes no paint of its own:
`renderResizer` hands it to the consumer, the way `SplitPane` hands over its gutter. Widths are clamped to the
column's own `minWidthPx` / `maxWidthPx` by `TableUtils.getResizedWidth`, and a drag that starts on a column
with no stored width reads the header cell's `offsetWidth` as its starting point.

**`InteractionWrapper` is not used, and this is the one control where that is right.** Its root is a real
element, and inside a row laid out by `grid-template-columns` the grid item has to be the `gridcell` itself —
a wrapper would become the item and the template would place the wrappers instead of the cells. The flags a
painter needs are computed directly instead: hover is tracked per row and per header column, focus comes from
the roving cell, and selection comes from the signal.

**A click inside a cell that lands on a control does not select the row.** The handler asks whether the click
target has an interactive ancestor within the cell — anchors, buttons, form fields and the ARIA roles that
stand for them — and stands down if so. Not a heuristic about what the consumer probably meant: it is the
same test the platform uses to decide what a click is for.

**Disabled is `aria-disabled` on the grid, and nothing else changes.** Cells keep their roles, their indices
and their tab stop, so the table still reads; sorting, selection and resizing all return early. Same mechanism
as everywhere else here.

**What was deliberately left out.** No column pinning — it needs a resolved pixel width per pinned column to
compute the sticky offsets, and a pin that silently does nothing on an unsized column is the "looks supported
and is not" failure this repo has refused twice already; it was also not in the scope the user set. No
grouping or aggregate rows, no expandable rows, no inline cell editing, no filtering, and no `F2`-style
interaction mode for a cell whose contents are focusable. The last of these is the one with an accessibility
cost: a cell containing several controls can be reached, but there is no defined key that steps _into_ it.

**The one gap inside the built scope is the resizer's discoverability, and the user chose to keep it.** The
handle is `aria-hidden`, so nothing announces that a column can be resized; a reader who does not already know
to try `Ctrl` with an arrow on a header cell will not find it. Two ways out were put to them and both were
declined: injecting a word like "resizable" into the header's accessible name, which the library cannot do
without writing into content the consumer paints, and React Aria's visually-hidden slider, which buys the
announcement at the price of one extra tab stop per resizable column — the exact cost the single-tab-stop grid
exists to avoid. **Their call was to leave it**, on the grounds that 2.1.1 is met and the tab order stays one
stop. It is recorded in `backlog.md` under _"Accepted limits"_ so it is not rediscovered as an oversight.

### Controls: `Scroller`, and why it renders no button of its own

Settled with the user. A strip too wide for its box, paged by a previous and a next button
rather than a scrollbar. The user asked for it as a `Carousel`; the name was corrected before anything was
built, because **a carousel is a different pattern with an accessibility contract this does not implement** —
one slide at a time, wrapping, `aria-roledescription` of `carousel` and `slide`, and a pause control the moment
it rotates by itself. Naming a component after what it resembles is the trap already recorded for the segmented
control. The real carousel is `Carousel`, which has since been built.

**The track holds arbitrary children, and that is the user's call.** It renders nothing and types nothing: the
consumer's markup goes in as `children` and comes out untouched. A list of records — `Tabs`' shape — was
rejected because the first consumer is a `Tabs`, which would then have been rendered twice over, and because
everything the component needs it can measure. Focus centring works by watching for focus reaching **any**
descendant. Paging lands on item boundaries by reading the track's own child elements, and where there is only
one child — the `Tabs` case — the rule degrades to a full page with no special case, because there is no
boundary inside the page to prefer.

**It never claims the arrow keys.** A `Tabs` inside it already walks its tabs with them, and two owners of one
key is a bug found later rather than sooner. The component listens; it never moves focus itself.

**A focused child is revealed, not centred, and the pointer counts the same as the keyboard.** Settled with the
user after the first attempt centred on keyboard focus alone: an item already fully in view does not move the
strip, and one cut off by an edge scrolls by the least that shows it whole. Centring is worse in both
directions — it drags a half-clicked item out from under the cursor, and it moves the strip when nothing needed
moving. Distinguishing pointer from keyboard was my patch for the first of those and it bought a second
behaviour to remember; revealing removes the cause instead, so one rule covers both. What it gives up is the
look-ahead a centred item has: a child revealed at an edge sits flush against it, with nothing of the next one
showing.

**It renders no `<button>`, which is the `NumberInput` shape rather than the `Tabs` one.** `renderButton` is
called once per button with which step it is and with a `ScrollerStepper` — `getIsAtStart`, `getIsAtEnd`,
`stepToPrevious`, `stepToNext` — exactly as `NumberInput` hands its steppers to `renderTrailing`. So the
consumer composes with `Button` and inherits naming, the focus ring, tooltips and the disabled treatment, and
the library owns only what nobody else can know: how far a step goes and whether there is anywhere left to go.
`getButtonPlacement` is `split`, `start` or `end`, since "together" cannot be placed without saying which side.

**The position is reported as a ratio, and a written ratio scrolls the strip.** `progressSignal` is optional
and goes through `SignalMirror.createOptional` like every other `*Signal`, and it carries `scrollLeft` divided
by the distance there is to travel — zero when nothing overflows. Reporting it is what the stepper cannot do:
page dots, a progress bar or a "3 of 12" readout all sit outside `renderButton`, and none of them could reach
the number. Accepting a write is the other half of the same variable, and it is what makes those dots
pressable rather than decorative.

**Which way a change came from is remembered rather than inferred**, because the track scrolls smoothly and
every intermediate frame reports itself. The component keeps the last ratio it wrote and ignores exactly that
value coming back; anything else is the consumer's and is scrolled to. Without it a consumer's write would be
cancelled by the first frame of its own animation — the report would land back in the signal, look like a new
instruction, and scroll to where the strip had got to instead of where it was sent.

**`getPadding` exists because a scroll container clips a focus ring, and only the consumer knows how big the
ring is.** A ring is drawn outside the border box and a scrolling box clips at its own edges, so a focused
child at either end loses part of its ring — and so does every child at the top and bottom, because a
horizontal scroller clips the cross axis too. The library paints no ring and cannot guess its width; the
Playground's is one exported constant, `FOCUS_RING_WIDTH`, used both by the `:focus-visible` rule and by every
`Scroller` that has to leave room for it.

Three things follow from that number, and all three are needed — leaving any one out clips a ring somewhere.
The track takes it as `padding-block` and `padding-inline-start`. **The end side cannot be padding**, because a
scroll container's end-side padding is still not interoperable — Firefox does not count `padding-right` as
scrollable space — so the component renders one element of its own after the consumer's children, sized to the
same number. And **the reveal leaves that room free**: a child is scrolled to sit the padding's width clear of
the edge rather than flush against it.

**`overflow-y: clip` with `overflow-clip-margin` is the purpose-built answer and cannot be used here.** Read on
MDN: when either axis is neither `visible` nor `clip`, a `clip` on the other axis computes to
`hidden`. The horizontal axis has to scroll, so the vertical `clip` would become `hidden` and
`overflow-clip-margin` would be ignored. Recorded so it is not re-proposed.

**The buttons leave when there is nothing to scroll; the track never does.** Asked for by the user on
as "just return the contents when there is nothing to scroll", and the smaller version shipped,
because the track is the only thing the component can measure. Whether there is anything to scroll is
`scrollWidth > clientWidth` **on the track**; unmount it and the children lay out in a box the component does
not own, so it can neither tell that they have started to overflow nor put itself back. A track with nothing
overflowing is also indistinguishable from a plain flex row — the scrollbar is hidden, nothing is clipped,
nothing is interactive — so the only visible things were two dead buttons and the gap they sat in.

**Removing them widens the track, and that is deliberate hysteresis rather than a loop.** With the buttons
present the content has the track's width to fit in; without them it has that plus their width and the gaps. So
content between those two widths settles wherever it currently is and stays there, instead of flickering
between the two states on every resize frame. The first measurement happens with no buttons rendered, so a
strip only gains them by genuinely exceeding its full width.

**The track hides its scrollbar and keeps its scrolling.** Wheel and touch still work — taking them away would
make the buttons the only route, worse than the scrollbar it replaced. `scroll-behavior` is smooth in CSS
rather than per call, so `prefers-reduced-motion` turns it off without the component asking.

**Horizontal only.** The axis is one variable rather than a redesign, but nothing has asked for a column and
`SlideButton`'s precedent is to build the axis that exists.

### Controls: `Carousel`, and the first component that acts without being asked

Built, alongside `Paginator`, from the description `backlog.md` had carried since the `Scroller`
naming argument. It shows one slide at a time, wraps at both ends, and can rotate on its own.

**One slide at a time, and a page of several slides is not built.** The description allowed either. One slide
is the reading with a published pattern behind it, and a page of several is `Scroller`'s territory the moment
the arithmetic starts asking how many fit — the boundary the two components were separated along. Recorded in
`backlog.md` as a gap rather than left implicit.

**Wrapping is the difference that makes it a different component.** `Scroller` stops at each end and disables
the step with nowhere to go; `Carousel` comes round, so neither step is ever the dead one. That single line is
why a shared implementation with a `wraps` flag was not attempted: the two disagree about what the ends mean,
and everything they appear to share — a track, a step pair — they hold for different reasons.

**The rotation is why this is a component rather than paint, and the holds are conformance.** WCAG 2.2.2
applies to anything moving by itself for more than five seconds beside other content: it must be stoppable, and
the published pattern adds that it must not move under the pointer or while it holds focus. So the holds are
not a courtesy that could be dropped for a tighter API. `getIsHeld` is `hovered || focus within || page
hidden`, which is `Toasts`' expression character for character. The explicit stop is separate from the holds
and outranks them: a stopped carousel stays stopped when the pointer leaves.

**The consumer arranges the controls; the library still owns every button.** `renderControls` receives a
`CarouselControls` object whose `renderStep`, `renderPick` and `renderRotationControl` **return elements**
rather than taking callbacks, so a consumer writes the bar — order, wrapper, position — while each control is
still a real `<button>` with a real name, built by the library. Deliberately not `Scroller`'s arrangement,
where the consumer renders the button and `backlog.md` records the consequence: a library that renders no
button cannot promise one is reachable or named. Here the split is along the line that matters — the library
owns what the control _is_, the consumer owns where it _sits_ and what it looks like. A consumer passing no
`renderControls` gets a carousel with no controls at all, right for one driven from elsewhere through its
`indexSignal`.

**Slides are plain values, not records.** Every other collection here takes records — `Tab<T>`, `TreeNode<T>`,
`Toast<T>` — because each has per-item capabilities the library acts on. A slide has none: its position is
arithmetic, not a field. The records convention was written against **parallel arrays** indexed at each other,
which a single list of values is not.

**The index is a two-way signal, and this is the clearest case in the library for it.** A rotating carousel
writes its own index on a timer with nobody having asked, which no consumer callback can be expected to mirror
back. `SignalMirror.createOptional` keeps it private until a consumer wants it.

**The announcement goes through `LiveAnnouncer` rather than a live region on the track.** The published pattern
makes the slide container a live region, which works when the slides that are away are removed from the page.
Here they stay — the track translates — and a live region over content that never changes announces nothing.
The shared announcer is already the answer for `Calendar`'s month change. It announces only when the carousel
is **not** rotating, because narrating a slide every few seconds is the noise WCAG 2.2.2 exists to prevent.

**The slides that are away are `inert` as well as `aria-hidden`**, for `Collapsible`'s reason: a control
scrolled off the side is still in the tab order without it, so a keyboard user would tab into a slide nobody
can see and drag the track after them.

**Both directions ship, as a `dir` prop of `"row" | "column"` defaulting to `"row"`** — the name and the union
`Tabs`, `Stepper`, `RadioGroup` and `SplitPane` already carry. Four things read it: the track's flex direction,
the slide's basis (a flex basis of `100%` is measured along the main axis, so one declaration means width in a
row and height in a column), the axis the transform translates on, and the swipe axis handed to
`InteractionTracker`, which already had a vertical mode for `Modal`. The step a committed swipe takes is now
one expression covering all four directions — left and up bring the next slide in, right and down the previous
— rather than a comparison per direction.

**Nothing in the markup names an axis, and that is the pattern's own position.** The published carousel pattern
defines a carousel as sequential display of slides and never mentions orientation; its controls are "previous"
and "next", which are sequence words rather than compass ones. `aria-orientation` is not among the attributes
`role="region"` supports, so there is nothing to set even if there were something to say. A column carousel is
therefore announced exactly as a row one is.

**A column carousel has no height of its own and takes it from the box around it, rather than from a prop.** A
row carousel gets its width from the page for nothing; a column one cannot get a height the same way, because
the track must be exactly one slide tall for a translation of `100%` to mean one step, and slides stacked in
normal flow make the track as tall as all of them together. So in column mode the root is `height: 100%`, the
viewport takes what is left of it after the controls, and the consumer's own element carries the number. That
is `SplitPane`'s arrangement — fill the box you are given, state no size. A `height` prop was the alternative
and was refused for the reason `DrumWheel` can require `wedgeSize` and this cannot: a prop mandatory in one
direction and meaningless in the other is a shape the type cannot state, which is the same objection that
keeps a drum carousel out of `Carousel`'s own props.

### `TrackCarousel` and `DrumCarousel`: one behaviour, two ways of showing it

A carousel and a drum wheel are the same picture driven by different arithmetic, which is what `Barrel` was
lifted out to make usable twice. The wheel spins to a wedge nobody chose; a carousel steps to a slide somebody
did. So the barrel is now shown by two components — one turned by `Rotator`, one turned by an index — and the
carousel's own behaviour, all of it, is shared between its two presentations.

**The shell is `Carousel` and it is not exported; the presets are.** Same arrangement as `Spotlight` and as
`OverheadWheel` / `DrumWheel`, and for the same reason: `slideSize` is required on the drum and meaningless on
the track, `renderSlideBack` likewise, and a single component with a variant prop could state neither. The
public names are `TrackCarousel` and `DrumCarousel`.

**The user took this knowing it reads worse than the sets it copies.** `Spotlight` and `Wheel` were shells from
the start, so no name was taken away when their presets arrived; here the plain `Carousel` was already the
component people rendered, and it is now the family name instead. `Track` was chosen over `Slide` because both
kinds have slides — naming a preset after the half they share is the fault `Flat` had, recorded above.

**`dir` belongs to the track and `axis` to the drum, and they are not the same word for the same thing.**
`dir` is a flex direction: it says whether the slides sit in a row or a column, exactly as it does on `Tabs` and
`Stepper`. `axis` is the line the barrel turns about, which is `DrumWheel`'s word for the same idea and takes
the same `"row" | "column"` values for the same reason — a row of faces turns about the upright axis. One prop
each, on the preset that has the concept, rather than one prop meaning two things.

**The drum keeps a running angle and turns the short way; the track slides straight to the index.** A face's
transform is derived from an angle, and an angle taken as `index × step` jumps from `0°` to `270°` on the first
forward step of a four-slide drum — a quarter turn that animates as three quarters backwards. So the shell
holds the angle itself, moves it by the signed shorter number of steps on each index change
(`CarouselUtils.getTurnSteps`), and resets it when the slide count changes underneath it. The track has no such
choice to make: its transform is `index × 100%` along one axis, which is already continuous, and it rewinds
visibly when a step wraps from the last slide to the first. **The two therefore disagree at the wrap**, and the
disagreement is not resolved here: making the track wrap the short way means moving a slide before it is shown,
which is a different mechanism rather than a different constant.

**A partial swipe turns the barrel by that fraction of a step**, the same way it drags the track by that
fraction of a slide, and it is written once: the swipe ratio times the step angle for the drum, times a slide
width for the track. What commits, what is thrown away, and what a hold does are all the shared shell's.

**`CarouselSlideState` gained a `face`, and the track's is always `"front"`.** A drum face can be the back of a
slide, which the consumer renders through `renderSlideBack`; the field is on the shared state rather than on a
drum-only one, exactly as `WheelWedgeState.face` is shared by a wheel that never has a back.

### `FlipCard`: the smallest thing that can turn a barrel

**A card is not a carousel, and inheriting the carousel's contract was the alternative that got refused.** The
options were a Playground example of a two-slide `DrumCarousel`, a preset over the carousel shell, and a
component of its own over `Barrel`; the user took the third. A card has no sequence — nothing wraps, there is no
picker, nothing rotates on a timer, and there is nothing to announce as "1 of 2". What it needs is two faces, a
side to show and a duration, and everything else the carousel holds would arrive as vocabulary a consumer has
to ignore.

**A flip card is the degenerate barrel rather than a special case of one.** At two faces the apothem works out
to zero, so the pair sits back to back with nothing between them, and the existing rule that a barrel prints no
reverse below three faces already covers it. Nothing was added to `Barrel` to make this component: two faces, an
angle of `0°` or `-180°`, and the same `computeFaceDefs` every other consumer uses. That it needed nothing is
the evidence the abstract was drawn in the right place.

**The barrel's own front and back are not the card's two sides.** A barrel slot has a front and a reverse; this
card's sides are two _slots_, at `0°` and `180°`. The distinction matters only when reading the code, and it is
why `FlipCardFace` is a different idea from `BarrelFace` despite being the same two words.

**The angle reverses rather than accumulating.** Flipping back turns the card the way it came, which is what a
hand does with a card. Nothing accumulates, so there is no running angle to keep — unlike the drum carousel,
which does keep one because it has more than two faces to reach.

**`flippedSignal` is required, and the card renders no control at all.** Two reasons, and the first is the
hard one: a card's faces hold arbitrary content, which may itself be interactive, so the card cannot be a
`<button>` without swallowing whatever is inside it. The second is `Carousel`'s recorded exposure — a library
that renders no button cannot promise one is reachable or named — which means the page must own the control
either way. The signal is required rather than optional because an internal one nobody can set is a card that
can never turn.

**It sits in `Exotics`, and it took two passes to get there.** The first placement was `Fundamentals` beside
`ImageSwitcher`, derived rather than asked: it swaps one piece of content for another with a transition, which
is what `ImageSwitcher` does for a single image. The user moved it. The `Exotics` test — renders DOM, holds no
value, lays elements out or turns them — takes it, and **turning is the part that decides**, which is the same
line `Cuboid` was placed on. Where the two folders divide was the user's call and now has an answer for the
turning components: a thing that rotates in space is an `Exotic` whatever else it also does.

### `Cuboid`: a box of six faces, and two counts that drive it

Asked for as "like the drum, but two axes of control, and not necessarily even faces". It shares the barrel's
perspective and its projection formula and none of its arithmetic, which is the honest split rather than a
missed reuse.

**Named `Cuboid` and placed in `Exotics`, both on the user's call.** It was built as `Cube` and the name was
put to them, since a component whose point is that the three extents differ is only a cube by accident; they
took the exact word. `Exotics` is where they put it, which also settles that the turning components belong
there rather than beside the carousels. `FlipCard` was left in `Fundamentals` at the time and has since been
moved across on the user's call, so the rule now reaches every turning component; the user noted that
`DrumCarousel` would fit `Exotics` too but that splitting the two carousels across folders is not worth doing
now. That last point is recorded in `backlog.md` under _Open discussion_ rather than settled here.

**What a screen reader is told is `box`, not `cuboid`.** `aria-roledescription` is read aloud, and the word it
replaces the role with should be the ordinary one — a listener meets "box, group" rather than a term they may
have to stop and parse. The exact word is right for the API, where the reader is a developer choosing a
component, and the plain one is right for the page.

**A barrel derives one radius; a box is told three extents.** Every face of a barrel is the same size, so the
distance from the axis follows from the face count by trigonometry. A box has a width, a height and a depth,
each face sits at half of one of them, and each face's own size is the two extents it spans — the sides take
the depth as their width, the lid and the floor take it as their height. There is no trigonometry anywhere in
`CuboidUtils`.

**The rotation is on the box; a barrel's is on each face.** A box turns as one about two axes, so one transform
on the body says everything: push back by half the depth, then pitch, then yaw. A barrel cannot do that,
because each of its faces sits at its own angle around a single axis. This is why `Cuboid` renders its own
markup rather than going through `Barrel`.

**Two counts of quarter turns, not a named face.** `yawSignal` and `pitchSignal` are unbounded integers, and
the angle is the count times ninety degrees. Three things fall out of that. The box always turns the way it was
pushed, because a count of `+1` is a quarter turn in that direction whatever the count already was. There is no
wrapping problem to solve — the drum carousel had to keep a running angle for exactly this reason, and here the
running total _is_ the API. And naming a face instead would have required the component to choose a route to it,
of which there are several, none obviously right.

**Turning over the top leaves the far side upside down, and that is kept rather than prevented.** The strategy
put to the user said the pitch would be clamped at a quarter turn either way, on the grounds that the two axes
collide there — on the lid, turning across spins the lid in place instead of bringing a new face. Built, that
argument does not hold up: clamping makes a second press of "up" do nothing, where a real box tips over its top
and shows its back inverted. So pitch cycles like yaw, the inverted states are reachable, and `cuboid.spec.ts`
pins the sequence. What is genuinely degenerate — turning across while on the lid — is left as it is, because
it is what a box does.

**The room it reserves is the silhouette of the sphere the box sits inside.** `BarrelUtils.getProjectedExtent`
is now the shared piece: it takes a circumradius and how far the centre sits behind the screen, and returns the
extent the projection can reach — `getGirth` is expressed through it and its numbers are unchanged, which the
existing wheel tests prove. `Cuboid` passes the half-diagonal of the whole box, so the reservation is correct at
every orientation including the ones that combine both turns. It over-reserves for a slab — a box 400 wide, 40
tall and 400 deep reserves a square of its diagonal — and that was chosen deliberately: the drum's reservation
shipped wrong twice, both times by being tight and self-consistent, and a box that paints outside its room
overlaps whatever sits beside it.

### The source view, as built, and the four calls the mechanism forced

Built against the two entries above. Where a rule had to be derived rather than read off, it is
marked as such.

**An example declares its own file, as a path from the Playground package's root.** `ExampleDefs.src` — a string of
already-highlighted HTML built at module scope — is now `path`, and the highlighting happens when the modal
opens; the `?raw` imports and `highlighter.codeToHtml` calls are gone from all six pages that had them. The
path is a plain literal rather than anything derived: `import.meta.glob` keys are relative to the Vite root, which is `playground/`, so
`/src/App/Pages/ShapePage/Examples/Default.tsx` is the same string the resolver looks up, and a typo
produces an empty tab rather than a wrong one.

**The sample-key mechanism is gone, along with the samples it addressed.** `sampleKeys` on `ExampleDefs`,
the `<Registry>/Samples/` resolver and the skip rule that stopped a registry dragging in sixty tabs all went
when the samples moved into the library, where the "everything from `components/src` stays opaque" rule covers
them for free. See _"Samples live in the library"_.

**Derived: a tab is a name, not a file, so `.const`, `.utils`, `.types` and `.css` collapse into one.** The
settled rule says the imported file plus its `.css.ts` and `.types.ts` siblings. Applied literally to
`SVGDefs.const.ts` it produces a tab called `SVGDefs.const` whose types sibling would have to be
`SVGDefs.const.types.ts`, plus a second tab called `SVGDefs` for the types file the const imports — two tabs
for one folder. The stem is therefore the file name with `.const`, `.utils`, `.types` or `.css` removed, so one
`SVGDefs` tab carries the const, the types and the utils. **What is displayed is still only what the settled
rule allows**: a file appears either because it was imported or because it is the stem's `.types.ts` or
`.css.ts`. A `.utils.ts` nobody imported does not appear.

**A sibling is displayed but never traversed.** A stylesheet reached only through another stylesheet is not
followed, which is the mechanism `Theme.css` was already meant to be kept out by.

**`Theme.css` is excluded by name as well, and it is the only file that is.** Settled with the user on
, after the mechanism gave `Card` a `Theme` tab honestly — the example does import the theme by
name. The user's reason generalises: **the theme holds no logic that helps build the component**, it is a
palette, and a tab of colour tokens teaches a reader nothing. The exclusion is a single path constant rather
than a pattern, so it stays a named exception rather than the start of a filter list.

**Forced: `?raw` cannot read a `.css.ts`, so the Playground's Vite config carries a nine-line plugin.** The
vanilla-extract plugin claims every `*.css.ts` by file name and discards the query, so a stylesheet requested
as text comes back compiled and with no default export — `codeToHtml` then receives `undefined` and the modal
renders nothing. `?source` resolves to an id no other plugin recognises (a null-byte prefix and a `.source`
extension) and is read off disk by the plugin itself. The only part of the feature living outside `src`.

**An example is given the key rather than the resolved sample, and three pages changed to do it.** Still true
of what the example's own body shows, though the tab that displayed the resolved sample is gone. `Shape`
passed `getStrokeConfig`, `getFillConfig` and `getIterationConfig` already looked up; `CellAnimation` passed a
`computeCellWeights` closure and a resolved origin; `ScanlineAnimation` passed a `computeCellWeights` closure.
All three now pass keys and the example does the lookup in its own body, which is the line the reader came to
see. `CellAnimation`'s stress test gains a correctness fix on the way: the origin is computed from the cell
count actually in force rather than from the page's.

**The code box's height cap is a per-call-site parameter.** A standalone box keeps its 800; the source view
passes 500, because a tab shows a list of section headers above the open one and the modal has to hold both.
Neither number moved.

**The scroll container is the modal, edge to edge, and the padding lives inside it.** Asked for by the user on
, so the scrollbar sits against the modal's edge rather than floating twenty pixels inside it.
`PageModalPanel` takes a `getPadding` that overrides its own, defaulting to what it always had — the
parameter-with-per-call-site-defaults rule, since the stress test and the modal page still want the padding.
The source modal passes zero and is the panel's only child. The "tap outside to close" hint went with it: the
panel is now one thing rather than two, and Escape and an overlay click were never spelled out on any other
modal.

**The padding then belongs to the scroller's children rather than to the scroller, because of the sticky
strip.** A tab strip inset by the container's padding leaves a band either side of it, and code scrolling
upward passes through those bands in plain view. A strip that spans the whole scrollport and pads itself covers
everything going under it. Its `z-index` also has to beat the code box's inset border, which otherwise wins by
sitting later in the document at the same level.

**A page's description lives on its tab config.** The title under which a page renders comes from `TAB_CONFIGS`
in `App.tsx`, so the sentence under it does too — one place, one entry per page, and a page without a component
keeps neither.

### Turning a page's variants into examples, settled on the four `Exotics` pages

`Formation`, `Satellite`, `Staircase` and `Wheel` were the first pages whose demos moved from `PageVariants` to
`PageExamples`, which was the first slice of the Playground rollout `backlog.md` used to carry as its own item.
The question that item left open — where a variant's file lives and what it is given — is answered here, and the answer is the shape
`ShapePage`, `TypewriterPage` and `ScanlineAnimationPage` already had rather than a new one.

**The split is the library call on one side and the Playground's furniture on the other.** The example file
holds the library component and the styled components it paints with, and nothing else. `PageMeasureBox`, any
local props panel and the width the demo is stated at stay on the page, in an `<Name>ExampleWrapper` beside
`getExamples`. That line is the same one the tab rule draws: what a consumer would write becomes a tab, what
the Playground needs for its own sake does not.

**What closed over the page's signals becomes one props type per page**, `<Name>ExampleProps` in
`<Name>Page.types.ts`, built with `AccessorProps` and handed to every example on the page as `commonProps`.
One type per page rather than one per example is what lets a single props panel drive all of them, which is
the rule the panel already worked to.

**A knob whose value has a unit names it in the label, in parentheses.** `Width (px)`, `Turn duration (ms)`,
`Shift (%)`, `Skew (deg)`. Asked for by the user after a page shipped with bare `Width` and `Turn`, and it is
the whole rule: a count has no unit and takes none, so `Slide count`, `Wedges` and `Items` stay as they are.
The field's own `ariaLabel` spells the unit in words instead — "width in pixels" — because the panel's label is
a plain `div` rather than a `<label>`, so the accessible name is whatever the field carries and a screen reader
never hears the visible text. The one place left without a unit on purpose is `Toasts`' duration: its values
are a select whose options print their own `ms`, and one of them is `sticky`, which is not a duration at all.

**A page may hold two components, and then the page's type is what the global panel drives rather than what an
example takes.** `ElementMosaic` and `ImageMosaic` had a page each and now share `MosaicPage`, one example
apiece. Three knobs mean the same thing to both — how many items, the gap, and which side is fixed — so those
stay global behind a single `MosaicExampleProps`, while each example file keeps its own props type for what it
actually receives: tiles on one side, image sources on the other. **What only one of them has goes in that
example's own local panel** — a target shape means nothing to an element mosaic, so it sits under the image
demo instead of in the global row. The user's instruction when merging the pages, and it generalises: share
what can be shared, make the rest local.

**The image mosaic's second demo became a knob on the first**, which is the rule above rather than a new one.
The decorated version differed from the plain one only in whether each image is wrapped in an element of the
consumer's own, so it is a checkbox in that example's local panel now. `imageMosaic.spec.ts` turns it on before
the one test that needs it, and addresses its demo by the example key `images` rather than by the page.

**Two demos differing by one prop are one example and a panel knob, never two files.** Corrected by the user,
four times now, and the fourth went further than the first three, in two steps. A carousel demo turned on its
side was built as its own example on the argument that a column also needs a box with a height around it, so
the two differed by more than the prop; that does not survive, because the box is the page's furniture. The
correction to _that_ was the second step and is the part worth keeping: **a knob that means the same thing to
every demo on the page belongs in the global panel, not in a local one per example.** Direction is one global
select now, and it drives the tracks' `dir` and the drum's `axis` together — a local knob per demo would have
been the same choice asked four times.

**Furniture that only one direction needs is still sized for both, so a card does not resize when a knob
changes.** The user's objection, and it is about the page rather than the component: the box round each
carousel demo was `height: 320` for a column and nothing for a row, so switching direction made every card
jump. It is one fixed height for both now, with the demo centred in it — a row carousel leaves slack under
itself and a column one fills it, and the card stays put either way. The first three corrections: `Formation`'s pair differed only in `getIsStackedInReverse`,
`Satellite`'s first two only in `getIsBehindSubject`, and `Staircase`'s only in `getDir`, and each was first
built as two example files with the value written into each. Every one of them is now a single example with
that prop wired to a control in the global panel — a `PageCheckField` for a boolean, a `PageSelectField` for
an enum. This is the same rule as _"a props-panel control drives every instance"_ read from the other end: a
value the panel could own is not a reason for a second demo, and two demos over one differing literal are two
copies of one example rather than two examples. **A second example has to be a different call**, as
`Wheel`'s three are — `OverheadWheel` against `DrumWheel`, and a drum handed the prize list twice over to prove it
can carry the same prizes round more than once.

**Dropping a demo drops its spec, and that is the trade to state rather than work around.** `Satellite`'s
third demo — the component with no satellite at all — was excluded on the user's instruction, so
`with nothing to attach there is no wrapper either` went with it. The behaviour is still covered by unit
tests; what is gone is the browser's confirmation of it.

**Where a sample registry is not split, the key is still the example's to resolve.** `Formation/Layouts` and
`Staircase/Indents` are 80 and 46 lines and stay whole. The example is handed `getLayoutKey` / `getIndentKey`
and does the lookup in its own body, because that is the line the reader came for. `sampleKeys` and the tab it
produced are both gone; see _"Samples live in the library"_.

**The turn count is a panel knob, and a spin style is handed it rather than owning one.** Asked for by the
user: the page exposed how long a spin lasts but not how far it goes in that time, so the only thing the
duration knob could change was the pace. `WheelSpinStyleFn` takes a third argument for it, after the two the
library's own `computeSpinDefs` passes, and the page closes over the signal at the call site rather than each
style reading it — which keeps the styles pure page constants that can be read whole in the source view.

**The two styles read the knob differently and both are right.** `rigid` uses it exactly. `bouncy` picks a
whole number between one and it, because randomness is what that style is for and a knob that fixed the count
would leave it randomising nothing but the jitter. So the knob is a ceiling for one and a setting for the
other, which is why it is labelled _"Turns per spin"_ rather than named after either reading. At the starting
value of 3 both reproduce the constants they replaced — `PLAIN_TURNS` was 3 and the lively range was 1 to 3 —
so nothing about the page's default behaviour moved.

**`WheelExampleProps.computeSpinDefs` is the library's two-argument shape, not `WheelSpinStyleFn`.** An
example spreads its props straight onto a wheel, so what it receives has to be what the wheel accepts; the
three-argument form is the page's catalogue signature and stops at the page. The two were the same type until
the knob arrived and the difference was invisible, which is worth knowing before merging them back.

**`Wheel` passes `computeSpinDefs` resolved rather than as a key**, which is the one place this departs from
_"An example is given the key rather than the resolved sample"_. Its two spin styles are page constants and not
a `Samples/` registry, so there is nothing for a key to resolve to; making them one is a separate change and
has not been argued.

**An example carries no readout, for now.** Stated by the user when these four converted. `ExampleDefs.readout`
stays on the type and `PageExamples` still renders one when given it — nothing was removed — but no example on
these pages sets it. Two specs read a readout and had to find the same fact elsewhere: `wheel.spec.ts` now
reads the wedge's name out of the `LiveAnnouncer` region, which is the library's own report rather than the
page's, and `satellite.spec.ts` used the readout only as a way to walk back to the demo and now locates the
wrapper directly.

**The attribute the interaction suite reads changes with the component.** `PageVariants` stamps `data-variant`
and `PageExamples` stamps `data-example`, so a converted page's spec swaps `variant()` for `example()` in
`e2e/helpers.ts`. One assertion had to move with it rather than being renamed: `wheel.spec.ts` counted the
buttons inside the whole card to prove the wheel renders exactly one, and an example card carries the source
button too, so the count is now scoped to the element carrying `aria-roledescription="wheel"`. That is the
honest reading of what the test was always claiming.

### Every Playground page is examples now, and two things had to change to finish it

The rollout `backlog.md` used to carry as its own item is done: all thirty-three pages that still used `PageVariants`
carry the source-code button, and `PageVariants` itself has no consumers left. What the four `Exotics` pages
settled held for the rest; two things they never exercised did not.

**An example card now marks its demo, because the source button is a button in the card.** `PageExamples`
wraps the demo in a `data-demo` element and `e2e/helpers.ts` gains `demo(key)` beside `example(key)`. Without
a marker a spec asking for "the first button in this card" found the `</>` button and opened the source viewer
instead of the control it meant — which is how a colour-dropdown test came to assert against a code listing.

**That marker is `display: contents`, and the first attempt at it broke six pages.** It was given
`PageVariants`' demo box — a centred flex row — which changed how every card lays its own contents out: the
pages that were already on `PageExamples` had always put a demo's children straight into the card's column, so
`CellAnimation` and `ScanlineAnimation` suddenly showed their local props panels **beside** their demos rather
than below. A marker exists to be found by a selector, not to lay anything out, so it generates no box at all.
Nothing inside a card can then move because of it, which is a guarantee rather than something to re-check per
page. The cost is that the element has no box to measure: `stepper.spec.ts` asked its parent how wide it was
and got zero, and now asks the card's content box instead.

**`readout` sits outside that box, and a spec that builds its selector from `demo(key)` finds nothing.** The
card holds the title, the demo and the readout as siblings, so a readout lookup is scoped to `example(key)`
and a control lookup to `demo(key)`. Both spellings are correct and they are not interchangeable.

**A readout is laid out at zero width with a minimum of the full box, so it never decides how wide its
example is.** Asked for by the user, and it is a testing requirement as much as a visual one. A readout is a
line of text about the control, and text is exactly as wide as whatever it happens to say — so a card sized
to fit it is a card that changes width every time the words change. On the wheel page that is several times
a second, because all three wheels report the wedge passing their marker while they idle, and the vertical
drum's card was measured at 376px when the drum inside it is 160px wide. A demo whose box moves under a spec
is a demo whose coordinates cannot be relied on, which is the half that matters beyond the look of it.

`width: 0` is what the browser uses when it works out how wide the card should be, so the readout counts for
nothing there; `min-width: 100%` is what it uses once the card has a width, so the text still renders across
the whole of it. Percentage minimums resolve to nothing during intrinsic sizing and to the real value
afterwards, which is exactly the split needed, and it is why the pair is not a contradiction. Note that this
also stops the readout stretching the demo beside it — `exampleContainer` stretches its children, so a wide
readout used to widen the demo box too, and the drum was being handed 336px of room it did not want.

`e2e/playgroundExamples.spec.ts` guards it without writing down a width for any control: it measures each
card, hides its readout, measures again, and the two have to match. Every card on every page with a readout
answers the same question, so a page added later is covered by adding its route to the list.

**A spec belongs to the route it visits, not to the file it is named after.** `tooltip.spec.ts` exercises
tooltips on the **button** page and `modal.spec.ts` covers both the modal and the drawer — so converting a
page turns specs red that carry another component's name, and converting one half of a two-page spec means
renaming only that half. The check before touching a page is `grep` for the route, never the filename.

**Demos kept their readouts, against what the four `Exotics` pages chose.** Those four set none, and
`ExampleDefs.readout` stays optional — but dropping the readouts here would have taken the fact each spec
reads with them, so every converted page still sets one. Whether they go is a separate pass.

**Every demo was carried across one-to-one, and the deduplication is deliberately not done.** Where two demos
differ by a single prop they now share one example file with two entries — `Accordion`'s two expand modes,
`Select`'s eleven country lists — which is the rule those four pages settled. What has **not** happened is
collapsing two demos into one plus a panel knob, because that removes demos and the specs covering them; the
user holds that as a separate pass.

**One demo needed pinning down rather than converting.** `SplitPane`'s bounded demo stretched until a pane's
160px floor stopped being reachable — with a wide enough frame the neighbour never reaches it, so the spec
proving the floor is honoured had nothing to bump into. `PageSplitPaneFrame` now caps at 380px, which is the
width it used to get. The alternative was to weaken the assertion.

### `PageExamples` lays out on a grid, with the column width per page and a span per example

Asked for by the user after the rollout: the cards went back to `PageVariants`' grid rather than the
wrapping flex row, since a row leaves cards of different heights sitting unevenly and gives a page no way to
say how wide its demos want to be.

**The root has to state `width: 100%`, which the flex row it replaced did not need.** Several page roots are
flex columns with `align-items: start`, which sizes a child to its content — so an auto-filling grid resolved
to a single column and stacked cards that had room to sit side by side. `CellAnimation` showed two rows in a
1280px area with two 630px columns available. A wrapping flex row hid this by sizing itself to max-content.

**The column floor is the page's, because it follows from the demo rather than from the layout.**
`getMinColumnWidth` defaults to the 320 `PageVariants` used, and a page that states a width for its demo
states a floor of that width plus the card's own padding — `SplitPane` 420 for its 380px frame, `Scroller`
460, `TextArea` 340. Where a page's demos have no declared width the default stands. It is a prop rather than
something derived because the demo's own width is often inside a styled component the page never names.

**An example may take more than one column, and the grid's floor is divided by the widest span on the page.**
`ExampleDefs.span` is a column count; `Tabs`' two demos that carry a panel and `Select`'s virtualized demo
with its own props panel take two. The floor becomes `min(100% / widest span, floor)` — so a page with a
two-column example never resolves to a single column, and the spanning card therefore never needs a track the
grid has not got.

**Two pages had been getting their sizes from the old row, and both showed it.** A wrapping row sizes a card
to its content, which had been hiding two things. `Shape`'s demo is a fixed, resizable 320px box with a `Shape`
around it tracing its outline — and `Shape`'s own root has no width, so under a card that stretches its
children it grew to the column while the box it traces stayed 320: the outline and the content came apart. The
box is what the demo is about, so the page now wraps it in a `width: fit-content` host and the `Shape` hugs it
again. `ViewportPage` builds its own cards rather than using `PageExamples`, and had capped them at the host's
width; it now uses the same grid, with a floor of the host plus the card's padding, and its fixed-size hosts
centre inside a column that can be wider.

**Which is the general lesson: a card stretches its children, so a demo that must match a fixed-size child has
to say so.** The old row let a demo of unstated width agree with a fixed-size sibling by accident, because
both ended up as wide as the card. Nothing about the grid makes that true.

**That division is what keeps a span from overflowing, and it was measured rather than assumed.** With the
plain `min(100%, floor)` a two-column card in a one-column grid lands one gap wider than the row: the grid
allocates a zero-width implicit track and the gap before it is still spent. Halving the floor removes the case
entirely — checked at container widths from 280px up, the row now overflows by nothing at any of them, and the
column count at ordinary widths is unchanged.

### `PageExamples` takes one layout switch, because the two questions turned out to be one

Settled with the user after the grid had been running for a while. The grid fixed what it was brought in for —
cards of a size, and a long readout no longer stretching one card wider than its neighbours — and broke two
things on the pages whose demos come at a fixed size. `Shape`'s card and its stress-test card were handed the
same track, which is right for two text fields and absurd for a 320px box beside three buttons; and neither
card was flush with what it held, so the page could no longer be read as "this is the room the component asks
for".

**Two dimensions were in play and they collapse into one.** How the demo sits inside its card, and how the
cards sit on the page. Once a card hugs its content there is nothing left to align inside it — the card _is_
the content — so hugging implies a wrapping row, and a wrapping row is only worth having if the cards hug.
`getLayout` is therefore a single prop with `grid` (the default) and `flow`, and no page states both.

**The rule for which is whether the demo owns its width.** A demo the page hands a size to is being shown for
its footprint, so the card has to be flush with it: `Shape`'s `fit-content` host, `Wheel`'s 340px overhead wheel,
every measure box that is given a width. A control that takes whatever width it is given — a field, a tree, a
tab strip — has no size of its own, any width is as arbitrary as any other, and an even column beats a ragged
one. Argued from ownership rather than from how the pages happen to look: a demo with no width cannot be
flush with anything, because there is nothing to be flush with.

**`grid` centres its demo rather than stretching it, and a demo that must fill says so itself.** The card was
a column that stretched its children, which was invisible while cards hugged their content and became a demo
pinned to the left edge once they did not. The demo slot is now a centred row. The alternative — keep
stretching and have the fixed-size demos centre themselves — was rejected by the user: it leaves the rule in
each demo's CSS, where a new example forgets it silently. Nothing had to be swept in for the change, because
a demo that has to fill already declares its own width and a declared width still fills a flex line:
`Progress`'s bar, `ColorArea`'s surface and `Tabs`' panels came through untouched. What moved is what should
have — `Tree`, `Breadcrumbs`, `DatePicker` and the link-shaped `Tabs` demos now sit at their natural width in
the middle of the card instead of being pulled to its edges.

**`ScanlineAnimation` uses measure boxes and stays on the grid, which is what sharpens the rule.** Its demo is
an image beside a local props panel, and that pair re-flows: inside a column it stacks, and freed of one it
lays out in a single 657px row, at which point two cards no longer fit a 1320px area and the page becomes one
card per row. So the test is the demo having a fixed size, not the page using a `PageMeasureBox` — a demo that
merely adapts to its container has no footprint to be flush with. `Shape`, `Wheel`, `CellAnimation`,
`ElementMosaic`, `Formation`, `ImageMosaic`, `ImageSwitcher`, `Satellite`, `Staircase` and `Typewriter` flow;
everything else stays on the grid. A flowing page drops `getMinColumnWidth`, since a hugging row has no
columns to put a floor under.

**The known cost of `flow` is that the readout and the title contribute their own width to a hugging card**,
which is precisely the unevenness the grid was brought in to remove. It does not bite in practice: a readout
and a measure box are near-disjoint across the pages — `ImageSwitcher` is the only page with both, and its
readout is narrower than its image. Worth stating because the first flowing page to grow a long readout will
show it, and the fix is to stop the readout contributing rather than to reach back for the grid.

### Controls: `Spotlight`, and three presets because a mode cannot move at runtime

Settled with the user, renaming `ElementHighlight` on the way. A spotlight cuts a hole in an
overlay around one element; what differs between uses is **what the page is still allowed to do**, and that
turned out to be three answers rather than a boolean.

**`SpotlightHint` points, `SpotlightPrompt` insists, `SpotlightGuide` explains.** A hint yields to anything — a
click anywhere dismisses it and so does any key that is not a bare modifier. A prompt makes the highlighted
element the only reachable thing and waits. A guide seals the page entirely, shows the element rather than
offering it, and puts the live controls in a popup beside it.

**They are three presets over an unexported base, and the reason is the user's rather than mine.** My argument
was that `renderPopup` is required on one and meaningless on the other two, which a mode prop cannot say in
types. Theirs subsumes it: **one variant can never become another while it is open**, so the choice is not a
runtime value and has no business being a runtime prop. `Checkbox` / `Toggle` / `Radio` over `BinarySwitch`
again, and `Drawer` over `Modal`.

**Escape stays live in every mode, and that is a conformance requirement rather than a kindness.** WCAG 2.1.2
No Keyboard Trap is Level A: _"If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard
interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface"_ — trapping is
allowed only _"as long as the user knows how to 'untrap' the focus"_, and Escape is a standard exit. So the
honest description of `SpotlightPrompt` is **"click it, or press Escape"**, and nobody may harden that away.

**`prompt` and `guide` seal the page by opposite mechanisms, because `inert` is inherited.** There is no "seal
everything except this one control": `inert` cannot be lifted off a descendant. So `guide`, whose hole is dead,
sets `inert` and gets hit testing, tab order and the accessibility tree in one attribute; `prompt`, whose hole
must stay live, keeps the overlay segments for the pointer and pulls focus back on `focusin` for the keyboard.
The cost is in `backlog.md`: `prompt` cannot hide the page from a screen reader.

**The seal climbs to the body rather than sitting on a root, because there is no root.** The content a
`Viewport` wraps is not a single node — the portal and the children are siblings inside it — and `Portal` nests
its own container inside the mount, so the page is two levels above anything this component holds. The walk
goes from the portal container up to `document.body`, inerting each ancestor's other children, which is the
same shape with a `Viewport` and without one. Elements already `inert` are skipped, or the cleanup would hand
back something that was never ours.

**Autofocus waits for the placement and then latches, and both halves were bugs first.** The popup is
`visibility: hidden` until `Anchor` has measured it, and a hidden element takes no focus — so autofocusing on
mount silently did nothing and left a sealed page with focus on the body. Then, because the position changes on
every step, an autofocus that kept following it threw focus back to the first control each time: press `Next`,
and the next press lands on `Skip all`. Both are pinned in `spotlight.spec.ts`.

**Every mode scrolls to what it highlights, and the mode makes no difference to that.** The user's call, over
the alternative of leaving `hint` out. The argument for leaving it out was that a hint points at something you
are already looking at, so moving the page under someone who did not ask is worse than not pointing; the
argument that won is that a spotlight aimed at something off-screen is useless in every mode, and that a rule
with one mode-shaped exception is a rule nobody remembers. So the effect reads the element and the visibility
and nothing else — it does not read `getMode`.

**It is `scrollIntoView({ block: "nearest", inline: "nearest" })`, which is what the highlighted-row controls
already use.** `Select`, `Menu` and `Clock` all scroll their highlighted row with `block: "nearest"`, so the
smallest movement that brings the thing into view is the house answer rather than a new one. "Nearest" also
means an element already fully visible is not moved at all, which is what keeps a hint from twitching the page
in the common case. No `behavior: "smooth"`: the rect is re-read every frame while the spotlight is open, so a
smooth scroll would work, but an instant one has no reduced-motion question to answer and matches the three
controls above.

**A step change is announced, and the words are the consumer's.** Focus deliberately stays where the reader
put it when a step changes — moving it is worse, for the reasons above — but that leaves a screen reader
hearing nothing at all as the popup's content is replaced under held focus. `announcement` is a string the
consumer sets per step, spoken politely through `LiveAnnouncer` whenever it changes while the spotlight is
open. The library owns neither the step count nor the title, exactly as it owns no toast's text, so it holds
no wording of its own; and the announcer's region is reserved on mount for the same reason `Toasts` reserves
its two, since a live region created by its first message may be silent for that message.

**It is announced on a change and never on the first show**, because the popup takes focus once it is placed
and a reader is already reading it there. Announcing the first step as well would say it twice, which is the
stutter this mechanism exists to avoid rather than cause.

**The Playground's guide example holds its steps in a strip one step tall, and that is deliberate.** The demo
page is short enough that both tour steps were always on screen, which made the scroll unobservable and the
spec unwritable. The strip is what reproduces a long page inside a card, and `spotlight.spec.ts` reads its
`scrollTop` — the same shape as `viewport.spec.ts` driving `[data-scroll-box]`.

### The hint example's moving buttons are bounded by a `PageMeasureBox`

The user's call, after the sliding buttons walked out of the example card — the vertical one worst, because a
column of two buttons reserves only their own height and the second then travelled a further two of its own
heights past the bottom.

**The travel was a fraction of the button, and it needed to be a fraction of a box.** Each wrapper slid
`translate(200%)`, which is 200% of the moving element, so the distance was set by how wide the words
"Highlight Me" happen to render and the container had no say in it. Both buttons now sit absolutely inside a
`PageMeasureBox` of a stated width and height, and each keyframe travels `calc(<box>px - 100%)` — the box's
size less the element's own — so the far edge of the travel is the far edge of the box exactly, whatever the
button measures. The checkered box is also the honest wrapper for this example under the Playground's own
rule: something moves inside its bounds, which is what `PageMeasureBox` is for.

**The two get separate lanes, because they would otherwise cross.** The horizontal one runs along the top and
the vertical one hangs from the right below it, so the horizontal one reaching the right-hand edge passes
above the vertical one rather than through it. The lane height is what the vertical one's travel is measured
down from, which is why the three numbers live together in `SpotlightPage.css.ts` and the component reads two
of them back for the box's props.

**240 by 200, because the narrowest column the examples grid produces is 320.** The card's own padding takes
40 of that, so anything wider than 280 overflows on a narrow viewport; the button measures 136 by 40, which
leaves a little over 100 pixels of travel on each axis.

**The `border-width` the keyframes used to animate was deleted with them.** Nothing set a `border-style`, so
the used width was zero at every step and the declaration painted nothing on any frame.

### `Abstracts/Elevation`: a height an element has without carrying a z-index

Built after a tooltip added to the hint example's sliding button turned up blurred and greyed while the
spotlight was open on that very button — the one element the spotlight exists to keep readable.

**Anchor already worked out its own height, and the method was right.** `AnchorUtils.getStackingBase` walks
from the anchor to the root, takes the largest `z-index` it passes, and the popup sits one above it. That is
why a hovered button's tooltip lands at 3: `interactionRoot` goes to 2 on hover. What the walk cannot see is
an overlay that is **not on the walk** — `Spotlight` portals its layers into the `Viewport`'s portal, so they
are siblings of the tooltip rather than ancestors of the button, and nothing in the button's chain says the
page has been covered.

**So the height is published rather than discovered.** A module-level registry holds element-and-z-index
pairs, the `DismisserStack` shape again: `Elevation.createElevation` registers on an effect and drops the
entry on cleanup, and `Elevation.getBase(element)` returns the largest registered height whose element
contains the one asked about. `Anchor`'s z-index is now the larger of the DOM walk and the registry, plus one.
`Spotlight` registers its highlighted element at `SPOTLIGHT_Z_INDEX` while it is open, which is the same
constant its four layers are styled with — it was a literal `10` written four times and is now one export, so
the paint and the registration cannot drift apart.

**Nothing is written onto the consumer's element.** The alternative was setting an inline `z-index` on the
highlighted element, which needs a `position` as well, mutates markup the library does not own, and — because
an element painting above the overlay is no longer part of its backdrop — would lift the element's own shadow
and focus ring out of the blur wherever they reach past the hole. The registry is a fact held beside the DOM
instead of a change made to it.

**The registry carries a revision signal, and that is not decoration.** The case that needs it is the ordinary
one: you hover the button, the tooltip opens, and _then_ you press it and the spotlight arrives. The z-index
memo has already run by that point, so without something reactive to depend on it would keep the height it
worked out before the page was covered. `spotlight.spec.ts` asserts the lift without hovering a second time
for exactly that reason.

**It is in `Anchor` rather than in `Tooltip`, so everything anchored to the highlighted element rises.** A
select's popup or a menu opened on it is as much part of "this element is still usable" as its tooltip, and
all of them come through `createPortalPosition`.

**The scale it lands in.** The house runs 1–2 for local lifts, 10 for overlays, 100 for a modal, 200 for
toasts. An elevated tooltip is 11, so it clears the spotlight and still sits under a modal opened over it —
confirmed as the wanted order by the user.

**Only the spotlight grants the lift; tooltips do not outrank overlays in general.** A `guide` seals the page
precisely so that nothing behind it can be read, and a blanket rule would have floated a sharp tooltip over
the elements it is sealing. The spec pins both halves: below the overlay's height on the plain page, above it
once the spotlight is on that element.

### `Spotlight`'s overlay is one masked layer and one clipped layer, not a ring of eight boxes

The user's suggestion, made while looking at `Reveal`, and taken as the option that keeps the pointer honest.
The first build cut the screen into the eight rectangles around the highlighted element and rendered the
consumer's overlay into every one of them, so the hole was a genuine gap in the DOM.

**A mask decides what is painted and nothing else, so it cannot replace the eight boxes on its own.** Hit
testing does not read `mask-image`: a single masked overlay looks right and then swallows every click over
the hole, which breaks `prompt` — the mode whose whole promise is that the highlighted control is still
usable — and makes the dark area of a `hint` include the one place a click must pass through. So the paint
and the pointer are now two layers rather than one: an overlay carrying the mask, `pointer-events: none`, and
a transparent blocker under it carrying a `clip-path` with the same rectangle cut out. `clip-path` **does**
take a region out of hit testing, which is what makes the blocker a real hole rather than a painted one.

**The blocker is transparent on purpose, and that is what keeps it out of the browser bug.** Chromium handles
`clip-path` and filters on the same element badly; the masked layer is where the `backdrop-filter` lives and it
carries no clip, and the clipped layer paints nothing at all, so the two never meet on one element. This is the
same shape as the rule the `Reveal` entry records for masks and filters, arrived at from the other side.

**One polygon with `evenodd` and a seam, because `clip-path: polygon()` is a single closed path.** There is no
way to give it two subpaths, so the outer ring returns to the origin, runs a zero-width segment out to the
hole's first corner, traces the hole, and runs the same segment back. Crossing a doubled segment changes
nothing under either fill rule, so the seam is invisible; `evenodd` is stated explicitly rather than left to
`nonzero` so a later edit that reorders the points cannot quietly fill the hole in. It is Baseline widely
available and has been since January 2020. `path()` would have allowed two honest subpaths and no seam, but it
takes no percentages, so the layer's own size would have had to be observed to write it.

**`renderOverlay` gained a third argument and now renders once.** The signature is
`renderOverlay(getVisibilityTarget, getTransitionDurationMs, getMaskStyle)`, and the consumer spreads the mask
onto the element it was already returning — the same handout `Reveal` makes to `renderCover` and `Shape` makes
to `renderChildren`, with the same cost attached: an overlay that ignores the style covers the hole as well as
the page, and nothing can detect the omission. The overlay container took `display: grid` so the one child
still fills it, which is what the individual segments used to do.

**What visibly changed, both ways.** Eight adjacent `backdrop-filter` elements each blur their own patch and
each clamps at its own edge, so the four lines running out from the highlight carried a faint seam; one layer
blurs continuously and they are gone, and it is one filter pass per frame rather than eight while the
highlighted element moves. Against that, the blur now samples across the hole's edge, so the highlighted
element's colour bleeds a little way into the darkened ring around it. That is inherent to blurring the whole
backdrop and then punching a hole in the result, and it is what `Reveal`'s frosted cover has always done.

**The mask itself is `Abstracts/Cutout`, shared with `Reveal`.** `CutoutUtils.getMaskStyle(hole, holeImage?)`
composes the full-coverage layer, the hole layer, their positions and sizes, and `mask-composite: exclude` with
its prefixed twin — a dozen property names that were about to be written twice. `Reveal` passes the SVG it
builds from its shape props as `holeImage`; `Spotlight` passes none and gets a plain `linear-gradient` layer,
which is a hard-edged rectangle and is exactly the hole it had before. **Softness and shape were deliberately
not added to `Spotlight`**: the generalisation makes them reachable, but a soft or rounded spotlight is a
design decision nobody has taken, and adding props under a refactor's justification is the thing that must not
ride along. Both pages now list `Cutout` in their derived Abstracts row, which is the mechanism working.

### `Anchor` positions against a rect when it is given one

Settled, and it is the virtual anchor `backlog.md` has wanted since `Menu`.
`createPortalPosition` takes an optional `getAnchorRect`; when present it replaces the observed rect and the
element observer is not attached at all. Everything downstream is unchanged, because the placement maths only
ever saw a rect.

Two consumers arrived together, which is what made it worth doing rather than inventing privately inside one of
them: a spotlight positions its popup against the **padded hole** it cut rather than against the element
inside it, and a right-click menu would anchor to the point that was pressed. The second is not built; the seam
it needs now exists.

### Four components arrived from a React codebase, and all four are `Exotics`

Placed there by the user, who wrote the originals: `Satellite`, `Staircase`, `Formation` and the two wheels.
Recorded because `Exotics` had no written definition and now has four more members, so the next arrival will
look for the rule.

**Derived rather than stated, and marked as such**: the four have in common that they render DOM, hold no
user-editable value, and are not compositions of `Fundamentals` — which is what would separate the folder from
its neighbours if a rule were written, rather than anything about how unusual a thing looks. All four lay
elements out or turn them; none is a control, and none is a `Surface`-style assembly of other components. The
user's call was where these four go; whether that is the general test is theirs to make.

**None of the original names survived unchanged, and two could not have.** `Tree` was already taken by the
`Fundamentals` control, and `DecorationWrapper` would have given the library a second meaning for
"decoration" — `InteractionWrapper.renderDecoration` is the full-box overlay behind a control, which is a
different mechanism. `Staircase` was kept, `Satellite` and `Formation` chosen with the user, and `TopWheel` /
`SideWheel` first became `FlatWheel` / `DrumWheel` on the argument that "top" and "side" describe where the
camera is rather than what the object is.

**That argument was overturned by the user, and the wheel is now `OverheadWheel`.** Where the camera stands is
exactly what distinguishes these two, and "flat" named the absence of perspective rather than the view — a
property of the drawing, not of the thing. `OverheadWheel` was taken over `TopWheel` because "top" reads as
topmost or best for a moment before it reads as a viewpoint, at the price of a longer name than the library
usually carries. `DrumWheel` keeps its name: "drum" names the object and needs no viewpoint to be understood,
so the pair is deliberately mixed rather than forced into `OverheadWheel` / `SideWheel`.

**What came across as paint stayed out of the library.** The originals shipped a leaf painter with five SVG
shapes, a wedge painter, a pointer, a banner and a starfield. `Shape` and `ShapeConst.getDefaultShapePoints`
already draw the first, and the rest are the consumer's half — they live in `StyledComponents` and are what
the Playground pages are made of. Nothing was lost: every one of them is on a page and reachable from source.

### `Satellite`: two elements, and a box that covers both

**The problem it solves is layout, not positioning.** A badge on a corner is easy to place with
`position: absolute`; what is hard is that the pair then measures as the subject alone, so the badge either
gets clipped by an ancestor or overlaps whatever sits beside it. `Satellite` grows its own box until both
elements are inside it, which is the whole reason it exists and the thing `satellite.spec.ts` pins.

**The placement vocabulary is `Anchor`'s, and this is where the in-variants pay.** The original took
`left | center | right` and derived the offset from half-widths, which can only express "outside that edge".
`AnchorPlacement` already had five values per axis, so a satellite can sit flush **inside** a corner —
the ordinary case for a badge on a card — and `AnchorUtils.getHPlacementShift` computes the position for both
families. The union arithmetic left over is nine lines in `SatelliteUtils.computeLayout`, with unit tests
against hand-computed numbers per placement.

**The wrapper grows by padding, and the subject stays in flow.** The first build absolutely positioned both
elements and wrote a measured pixel width and height onto the root, which is what the React original did. It
means the root has no size of its own until two `ResizeObserver` callbacks have run, so the first painted frame
is a 0×0 box with the subject spilling out of it, and a subject that wanted to size itself from the parent
could not. Padding inverts it: the root's box is the subject's box plus the overhang on each side, an
absolutely positioned satellite is placed against the **padding box** so its offset needs no correction, and
before anything is measured the padding is zero and the layout is simply the subject. Nothing flashes.

**The wrapper shrinks to its subject, because otherwise it measures a box nobody drew.** The padding
scheme only works if the number fed to `computeLayout` as the subject's size is the subject's size. What is
observed is not the child the consumer passed but the `satelliteSubject` div wrapped around it, and that div
is an ordinary block: it takes the full width of whatever contains it. A 140px subject inside a 260px parent
therefore measured 232px wide, and `right-out` put the satellite 92px past the subject's right edge, floating
in space. `satelliteRoot` carries `width: fit-content`, so the root shrinks to the subject's own width, the
wrapper reports that width, and the placement lands on the corner. The horizontal case is the only one that
was ever wrong — a block already shrinks to its content vertically, which is why the growth up and down looked
correct all along.

The subject still fills the root: `satelliteSubject` has no width of its own, so it takes the whole content
box, and the root's width is the subject's intrinsic width plus the overhang. What the root will not do is
stretch to a parent wider than the pair, which is the premise rather than a cost — the component exists to
hand the parent a box that is exactly the pair, and a box that grows to fill cannot also be a measurement of
what is inside it. Where a satellite needs to sit somewhere the placement vocabulary does not name, the
offset reaches it. Confirmed by the user as working as designed.

**The offset is a nudge in screen space, and that differs from `Anchor` on purpose.** For a floating layer the
offset means a **gap**, so `AnchorUtils.getHPlacementOffset` signs it by the placement and discards it entirely
on a centred axis. A consumer placing a badge is aligning it rather than clearing a gutter, and "nudge it two
to the right" must not become "two to the left" because the placement flipped, nor be silently dropped because
the axis is centred. So `computeLayout` adds the offset raw. Stated because the two components share the
placement type and disagree here.

**With no satellite there is no wrapper.** `renderSatellite` is optional and the component renders its children
bare when it is absent, so a consumer whose badge is conditional does not pay a positioned box for the case
where there is nothing to position. Lifted from the original, which did the same thing for the same reason.

### `Staircase`: the direction is the component's, and the curve is the consumer's

**A step's indent comes from a function of its index**, and the four curves the original shipped —
linear, a broken bilinear, repeating, alternating — are `CellAnimation`'s weights again: one opinion about how
to author the function the component actually asks for. They are samples under
`Samples/Staircase/Indents`, and only the linear default lives in the component, because a component with a
required function and no default cannot be written down in one line.

**The direction knob hands the steps back to front instead of being passed down.** Every one of the original
functions took a `direction` argument and half of them ignored it, named `_direction` to say so. Reversing the
index before the function sees it puts the flip in one place, and the function's defs shrink to the three
fields all of them use. The e2e spec asserts the two staircases on the page are each other's mirror, which is
the property that arrangement buys.

**Indents are physical padding on a wrapper, not a logical property.** `padding-left` and `padding-right`
rather than `padding-inline`, per the field convention: the value is symmetric so the two are equivalent
today, and physical throughout stays honest while nothing else here is RTL-aware.

### `Formation`: positions written as fractions of the width, and nothing measured

**The original measured its own width with a `ResizeObserver`, computed pixel insets from it and carried a
comment saying to remove all of that once container query units existed.** They exist. Every inset a layout
function returns is a fraction of the formation's inline size, the component writes them as `cqw`, and the
browser resolves them — so there is no observer, no state, no frame of wrong layout on mount, and no
arithmetic to redo when the container changes size. `formation.spec.ts` checks a written position against the
root's measured width, because the failure mode is silent: with no query container in scope `cqw` falls back to
the small viewport width and every item lands somewhere plausible and wrong.

**The root's own height comes from a spacer child, because an element cannot query itself.**
`container-type: inline-size` makes the root a container for its **descendants**, so a `min-height` in `cqw` on
the root would resolve against whatever container sits above it. A single in-flow spacer whose height is the
layout's `heightRatio` in `cqw` gives the root its height instead. There is no circularity: inline-size
containment leaves the block axis free, which is exactly the case that unit was designed for.

**The podium arrangement sat unevenly in its box, and the fault was vertical rather than horizontal.** The
sideways offsets are deliberate — first place at 0.4375 of the width with the other two at +0.25 and -0.125
from it, which leaves an equal margin at each side even though the three are not symmetric about first place.
What was wrong is that the first row started a quarter-and-a-bit down while the last row ended flush with the
bottom, so the arrangement had a gap above it and none below. It now starts at its own half-height, the way
the whorl arrangements already did, and `formation.spec.ts` measures the four margins rather than any one
coordinate — which is the assertion that would have caught it, and the one that does not have to be rewritten
when a sample's numbers change. Corrected by the user after a first attempt moved the horizontal offsets, which
were never the problem.

**Width-relative rather than height-relative, so a taller parent leaves space instead of stretching.**
`top` and `height` are in `cqw` too, not in percentages — a percentage `top` resolves against the height, and
an arrangement stretched vertically by a parent that happened to be tall is a distorted podium. Every number
in a `FormationLayout` is therefore in one unit, and `heightRatio` is the honest bottom edge of the lowest
item rather than the original's hand-tuned trims.

**This is the first use of container query units in `components/src`, and it carries no fallback.** Argued on the
terms _"Compatibility arguments cite `components/src` and nothing else"_ sets: caniuse puts the units at 94.05%
globally, from Chrome 105, Safari 16 and Firefox 110. `InteractionWrapper.css.ts` already depends on `:has()` with no
fallback — 94.07%, and Firefox 121, which is **ten months later than the unit being added here**. So the
published package already requires a strictly newer browser than this does, in the one component every control
passes through.

### `Rotator`: the behaviour both wheels share, with no DOM of its own

**A wheel that spins to an index is arithmetic plus a small state machine, and neither is markup.** The
original had a `useRotationEffect` hook shared by its two wheels and left everything else — where to stop, how
far to overshoot, whether to idle — in a consumer hook beside the styled components. `Abstracts/Rotator` takes
the whole of it: `RotationUtils` is the pure angle maths with unit tests, and `createRotator(ref, disabled,
defs)` holds the phase, the timers and the holds.

**The angle only ever increases.** `getSpinAngle` rounds the current angle up to a whole turn, adds the turns
asked for and then the target index's angle, so a spin is always forward however many times the wheel has been
spun. Testable in one line, and the property a consumer would otherwise discover by watching a wheel unwind
backwards.

**A spin overshoots and then settles, which is two turns rather than one.** Landing dead centre on the
wedge looks mechanical, so `computeSpinDefs` may return a `jitterRatio`: the wheel spins to the target plus
that fraction of a wedge, then corrects to the centre over the settle duration. `getJitterAngle` clamps the
ratio to half a wedge, because past that the wheel would come to rest on a different wedge from the one the
index names — the clamp exists to protect that correspondence, not to be tasteful.

**Nothing random is in the library.** Turn counts and jitter are the consumer's, defaulting to three turns and
no jitter, which makes the component deterministic and its e2e spec possible. The lively version — random
turns, random jitter — is a Playground sample, the same line `CellAnimation` draws around its weights.

**The index is the settled selection, so it is published at the end rather than the start.** A consumer bound
to `indexSignal` is showing what was won; writing it when the spin begins would reveal the answer three seconds
early. The target is held privately until the settle, which is what the original's `prizeIndexRef` was doing.
`onSpinEnd` fires there too, and so does the announcement.

**Where the target comes from is the consumer's, and the wheel asks for it.** `computeSpinTarget` may return a
promise, because the real case fetches a prize from a server. While it is outstanding the wheel is not
spinnable and says so, or a second press would start a second fetch — the original guarded this with a
`canSpin` flag and the guard has to be reactive, since the spin control's disabled state is drawn from it.

**A spin is a command, not a state.** `spin()` arrives through the `onMount` handle, per _"Playback is a signal; a
rewind is a command"_ in `conventions.md`. Whether the wheel is turning by itself **is** state, so it is
`autoSpinSignal`, and so is the settled index.

**The abstract publishes no handle of its own.** `RotationController` existed and was passed straight
through by `Wheel`; it is gone, and `WheelController` is the only one. An abstract with no DOM has no
consumer to hand anything to — the component that owns the element owns the handle, and one handle in wheel
vocabulary beats two in two vocabularies for the same thing.

**The wheel computes its own angle every frame; CSS no longer interpolates anything.** This replaced the
original arrangement, in which `Rotator` set a target angle, published a duration and a timing-function name,
and let a `transition` on the wedge do the moving while a `setTimeout` of the same length stood in for "the
turn has finished". The user asked for the change, and the reason is that the browser was the only thing that
knew where the wheel actually was. Mid-transition the angle signal already held the destination, so nothing in
the library could answer "which wedge is under the marker right now" — the question only had an answer at the
two ends. Now `turnTo` walks the angle from where it is to where it is going, one `requestAnimationFrame` at a
time, through `EasingUtils.ease`, and the angle signal is the truth at every instant.

**Three things came out of it beyond the live index.** The spin no longer takes its starting angle from the
destination of an idle step that had not finished. The turn ends when the turn ends, rather than when a timer
guesses it has. And nothing on a wedge interpolates any more, so a change to any input the transform is built
from — the wedge count above all — applies on the next frame rather than being animated to. Measured on a
turning two-wedge drum, the faces now sit inside the width the component reserves at every angle of the turn.

**The idle turn became continuous rather than a step per delay.** It used to set the angle one wedge forward
and let a linear transition of `idleDelayMs` carry it there, which is a sawtooth of targets that happens to
look smooth. The frame loop advances by `stepAngle / idleDelayMs` degrees per elapsed millisecond, which is
the same motion described directly. `idleDelayMs` keeps its meaning exactly — how long one wedge takes to pass
— so the panel knob still reads the way it did. It also means the turn stops where it is when idling ends,
rather than running on to the step it had already committed to.

**The spin carries a starvation fallback and the idle turn does not, and the split is the point.** A page that
is not painting — a background tab, a throttled window — hands out no frames, so a loop built on them alone
stops advancing while timers carry on. `ElementFader` already answered this once, and the answer here is the
same shape: `turnTo` arms a `setTimeout` for the duration plus `FRAME_STARVATION_SLACK_MS` beside the frame
loop, and whichever arrives first lands the angle and runs the arrival. Without it a visitor who starts a spin
and switches tabs comes back to a wheel stopped part-way round, no prize announced, `onSpinEnd` never fired
and the spin control disabled for good. The idle turn gets no such fallback, deliberately: it owes nobody an
answer, it is already suppressed for a hidden page and for `prefers-reduced-motion`, and arming a timer to
shuffle a wheel nobody can see would be worse than doing nothing. `e2e/noAnimationFrames.spec.ts` drives both
halves.

**`isSelected` says the wheel has picked this wedge out, which is not the same as the wedge being at the
marker.** The user's sequence, and it is the one to keep: a wheel turning by itself has picked nothing, a
wheel spinning has picked whatever is passing the marker right now and moves the pick as it turns, a wheel
that has settled has picked the prize and holds it for the rest, and when the rest runs out and the turn
resumes the pick goes away again. So `isSelected` is the live index everywhere except while idling, where it
is nothing at all. Painting the passing wedge during an idle turn would tell a visitor the wheel had chosen
something it has not, and the first build had the opposite failure — `isSelected` was the settled index, so
one wedge was lit from page load and never moved, including all the way through a spin.

**That is deliberately not the same rule as `onSelectedWedgeChange`, which fires during the idle turn too.**
The two answer different questions. `isSelected` is paint, and a wheel with nothing selected must paint
nothing. The callback is position, and position exists whenever the wheel is moving — a consumer wanting a
tick per wedge as it passes needs it exactly while the wheel is idling, which is when a gated callback would
be silent.

**The drum's `aria-hidden` and `inert` stay on the settled index rather than following the pick.** They mark
which face a screen reader may reach, and moving that with the turn would rewrite the accessibility tree
tens of times a second while the drum idles, for a face nobody is going to stop on. Paint may follow the
angle; what assistive technology is offered should not.

**The wedge under the marker is reported through a callback, not published as a signal, and it is not the
index.** `getIndex` stays what it always was — the settled selection, written when the spin ends, because a
consumer bound to `indexSignal` is showing what was won and writing it at the start would give the answer away
three seconds early. What the frame loop makes newly available is a different quantity: which wedge happens to
be at the marker at this instant, which during a spin is a stream of values and none of them the result. The
user's call on its shape: `onStepChange` on the abstract, surfaced by `Wheel` as `onSelectedWedgeChange`, and
a callback rather than a signal because the wheel reports and nothing writes back — there is no second owner
for a two-way binding to serve. `RotationUtils.getAngleIndex` is the arithmetic, the exact inverse of
`getIndexAngle`, and it rounds, so a wedge holds the marker until the halfway point of the gap to the next.
It fires on every change including during the idle turn, which is what a consumer wanting a tick per wedge
needs.

**The idle turn runs indefinitely, and rests only after a spin. This replaced an arrangement built on holds,
and the replacement is the user's.** The first build stopped turning whenever the pointer was over the wheel,
whenever anything inside it had focus, and for good once a spin had settled. All of that is gone. The wheel now
turns by itself for as long as it is on the page, with one exception: a hidden tab stops it. **Reduced motion
was a second exception and is not any more** — see the entry below.

**After a user spin settles, the wheel rests for `restDurationMs` and then picks up again; `-1` rests for
good.** The rest is its own private state, deliberately not the same thing as the auto-spin switch, because the
two have different owners — the rest is the component saying "let them read the prize", the switch is the
consumer saying "not now". Folding them into one flag meant a consumer's pause being cancelled by a rest timer
they never started. `DEFAULT_REST_DURATION_MS` is 3000 and is mine, not measured; change it freely.

**A pause on hover is now the consumer's to build, and `autoSpinSignal` is the door.** This is the settled
`playbackSignal` rule applied again — whether the passive turn is running is state a consumer can read and
write, so it is a two-way signal rather than a `pause()` on the mount handle. A consumer wanting the old
behaviour writes `false` on pointer enter and `true` on leave, over their own box, which is also the only way
to cover a control that sits **on top of** the wheel rather than inside it. The library cannot do that for
them: the hold it used to keep listened for the pointer arriving on the wheel's own element, and a button
overlapping the wheel is a neighbour rather than something nested inside, so it took the pointer away from the
wheel instead of holding it.

**`getIsHeld` is gone from the handle, and `getIsPlaying` is now two getters.** `isHeld` existed for one
purpose — deciding whether to suspend the idle turn — and with the holds gone it had no consumer. The
playing flag was doing two jobs at once, so it is split at the seam the user named: `getIsAutoSpinning` is true
while the wheel turns by itself, `getIsUserSpinning` while it is fetching a target, spinning to it or settling
on it. Both are views of `getPhase`, which remains for anyone wanting the four states apart.

**`createRotator` no longer takes an element.** The hold was its only use for one, so the abstract is now what
its own heading claimed: a state machine with no DOM whatsoever. `InteractionTracker.trackPageHidden` was split
out of `trackHold` so the page-visibility half could be used without the pointer and focus halves; `trackHold`
composes it and is unchanged for `Carousel` and `Toasts`.

**WCAG 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A), and the user's answer to it.** The normative line: _"For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts
automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a
mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an
activity where it is essential"_. All three conditions now hold with nothing to answer them. The earlier reading
recorded here — that the motion is essential to the control — was written when the wheel came to rest on a spin
and stopped under the pointer; an attract-mode turn that never ends is a harder thing to call essential, since
the essential activity is the spin and this is what happens while nobody is spinning. What is left is
`prefers-reduced-motion`, which is a real user-side control but is not among the criterion's sufficient
techniques, and `autoSpinSignal`, which is a capability handed to the author rather than a mechanism offered to
the visitor.

**The user's position is that the criterion's own exemption applies: the motion is essential, because spinning
is what a wheel is, and "essential" is a subjective qualifier the criterion leaves to judgement.** Put to them
with the analysis above and answered directly; recorded as their reading, which is the standing the earlier
version of this note had too. A consumer who wants a pause control still has `autoSpinSignal` to build one
against.

The user-initiated spin is outside the criterion in any case — it does not start automatically — and it is the
essential activity, which is what 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions exempts at AAA.

**The wheel no longer reads `prefers-reduced-motion` at all, and this is a deliberate reversal.** It used to be
one of the five conditions on the idle turn, so a visitor asking for less motion got a wheel that waited to be
spun. The user's call, taken when `PointerTracker` raised the same question: the library reports and the
consumer decides, and the door is already open — `autoSpinSignal` and an absent `idleDelayMs` both stop the
idle turn, and either can be driven from the preference in a line at the call site. Nothing was resting on the
internal check: the analysis above already records that `prefers-reduced-motion` is not among 2.2.2's
sufficient techniques and that the user's answer to that criterion is the essential-activity exemption, so
removing it changes no conformance claim. **The Playground is now the consumer that answers it** — `WheelPage`
reads the query and returns no `idleDelayMs` under reduce, which is what keeps `e2e/wheel.spec.ts`'s
reduced-motion expectation true. That spec is testing the Playground's behaviour, not the library's, and its
prose still reads correctly.

`Carousel` and `Toasts` keep the three-part hold; the wheel no longer has one at all, so what they share now is
only `trackPageHidden`.

**The result is announced through `LiveAnnouncer`, only on settling.** Same argument as `Carousel`: the wedges
are all still on the page, so a live region over them announces nothing, and narrating an idle wheel every few
seconds is the noise 2.2.2 exists to prevent.

### `OverheadWheel` and `DrumWheel`: two presets, because a wheel cannot become a drum

**They share behaviour and no markup at all.** One rotates in the plane of the screen; the other is a barrel
seen edge-on, with a front and a back face per wedge, a perspective ancestor and a size derived from the
wedge's own extent. A single component with a mode prop would be `Scroller` and `Carousel` again —
everything they appear to share, they hold for different reasons.

**So the split is `Spotlight`'s exactly**: an unexported `Wheel` shell holds both markups behind one variant
prop, each preset is a one-line pass of that variant, and only `Wheel.types` and `Wheel.utils` are exported.
The public API cannot express a variant change at runtime, which is the point, and the props each preset needs
differ in a way a mode prop could not state — `renderWedgeBack` and `wedgeSize` are required on the drum and
meaningless on the flat one.

**The drum's geometry is the component's; the wedge's shape is the consumer's.** `WheelUtils` computes the
apothem, the circumdiameter and the girth, because the shell cannot lay a barrel out without them; it does not
compute the pie-slice path, because a wedge could be a card, an image or a label on a ring, and the shell never
needs to know. That is the same line `Paginator` draws from the other side: its entries are arithmetic the
component needs to render, so it owns them.

**A wedge's content is sized from the slice it sits in, in container query units, and nothing is measured.**
The original's wedge content was authored against a 600px wheel: it watched the wheel with a `ResizeObserver`,
divided the measured height by that base size, and multiplied the content's `scale` by the result — then
multiplied again by `min(12 / wedgeCount, 1)` so the content shrank once the wedges outnumbered twelve. Both
multiplications are gone, replaced the way `Formation`'s insets were and for the same reasons: the label's box
and its type size are fractions of the wheel's own width written as `cqw`, so the browser resolves them and
there is no observer, no base size, and no frame of wrong layout on mount. `wheelWedge` carries
`container-type: inline-size`, which makes one `cqw` a hundredth of the wheel's width — the same unit the
wedge path's `viewBox` is drawn in, which is why one geometry function returns numbers that serve both the
path and the label.

**The room a label has is the width of the slice at the radius where the label starts, bounded twice.** The
two straight edges bound it as `radius × tan(halfAngle)`, and the arc bounds it as
`√(wheelRadius² − radius²)`; the narrower of the two is the one that applies. Taking only the first puts the
label's top corners outside the circle at low counts — at four wedges the straight edges are 45° off vertical
and give a half-width larger than the circle has left at that radius. Taking only the second is the
original's `paintedSize.width`, the chord between the slice's two rim corners, which is wider than the slice
is anywhere the label actually sits. The half-angle is clamped to a right angle so that two wedges, where the
edges are parallel and the tangent is unbounded, fall to the arc bound rather than to infinity.

**The count-based shrink was inert on the page, which is why the labels collided.** `min(12 / wedgeCount, 1)`
is exactly 1 at every count the props panel offers, since the panel stops at twelve — so the mechanism the
original had could never be seen, and the label box was the full width of the wheel rather than the width of
the slice, so at twelve wedges each label ran across its neighbours. Sizing the type from the slice bites at
every count instead of only past a threshold, and it needs no reference count to be kept in step with the
length of the prize list.

**Two paint constants carry it, and they are ratios rather than sizes.** `LABEL_RADIUS` is how far out from
the middle the label's top edge sits, in `viewBox` units, and `LABEL_TYPE_RATIO` is the type size as a
fraction of the slice's width there. Both are the consumer's half — a wedge could be a card or an image, and
the library never sees either number.

**Type size rather than a `scale` transform, which is what the original used.** A scaled box lays out at its
unscaled width and paints at the scaled one, so clamping the box to the slice and then scaling it down leaves
the paint narrower than the slice — the room would have to be divided back out by the same factor to come out
even. Setting the type size instead keeps layout and paint in one space, and the gap between lines is in `em`
so it follows without a second rule.

**The girth is the diameter after perspective, and the constant it replaced was a fudge that broke.**
Foreshortening means the barrel needs less room than the circle it turns in, and the original took a flat 1% off
per wedge to approximate that. Within the counts it was written for — eight to twelve portrait faces — it lands
within a few percent of the truth; at sixteen faces it takes 16% off and the drum paints outside the box it
reserved, which is the rule `InteractionWrapper` states as _"the wrapper's box has to equal the painted box"_.
So the approximation is gone and the arithmetic it was approximating is in its place:
the width at which the eye's line of sight **grazes** the drum, which is
`2 × perspective × circumradius ÷ √((perspective + apothem)² − circumradius²)`. `DRUM_PERSPECTIVE_PX` is
exported and applied as the inline `perspective`, so the number the CSS uses and the number the box is computed
from cannot drift apart.

**The obvious formula is wrong, and it was shipped once before being caught.** Measuring at the axis —
`circumdiameter × perspective ÷ (perspective + apothem)` — reads the width of the drum where its axis sits. But
the silhouette is not there: the tangent points are **nearer the eye** than the axis, so they project wider. The
error is the factor `(perspective + apothem) ÷ √((perspective + apothem)² − circumradius²)`, which is a fraction
of a percent on a narrow drum and grows with the ring, reaching 2.6% at twelve faces 150px wide — twelve pixels,
visible against a dashed outline, and worse at higher counts. **This is the second wrong answer here**, after the
original's flat percentage per wedge, and both failed the same way: right in the middle of the range they were
checked in, increasingly short outside it. The user caught both by eye.

**What the geometry is checked against is the rendered result, not the derivation.** The reserved box is measured
against the union of the faces' own boxes, at every count from two to twelve, at rest and sampled forty times
through a continuous turn. That is the assertion that would have caught either wrong formula, and neither unit
test would have. Two faces back to back have no depth at all and one face has no barrel, so the apothem
is zero below two wedges rather than the infinity the tangent gives.

**A drum turns about either axis, and the Playground shows both.** `axis: "row"` rotates about the upright
axis so the faces travel left and right — the original's arrangement — and `axis: "column"` rotates about the
level one so they travel up and over, which is a reel. The extent the geometry works from is the wedge's width
in the first case and its height in the second, which is why a landscape face makes a compact reel and a wide
drum: the same card is the small dimension one way round and the large one the other. **The reel carried each
prize round twice at first, and the user took that out** — nothing on the page now demonstrates that a wheel's
wedges need not be one per option, and the component still allows it.

**The wheel renders no control at all, and hands out a handle instead. This reverses `Carousel`, and the
reversal is the user's.** `renderSpin`, `renderControls`, `computeSpinLabel` and the `<button>` behind them are
gone. What replaces them is `onMount(controller)`, carrying `spin()` plus `getIndex`, `getPhase`,
`getIsSpinnable`, `getIsAutoSpinning` and `getIsUserSpinning` — so a control **anywhere on the page** can spin
the wheel and can disable itself while a spin is outstanding, which is the whole of what the built-in button
knew.

**Nothing the consumer already holds is on the handle.** A `getWedgeCount` was there and the user took it off:
the wedge array is the consumer's own prop, so its length is theirs to read and the wheel repeating it back is
a second source for one fact. The test for a member is whether the wheel is the only place it can be
known — `getPhase` and its two derived spinning flags are internal outright, and `getIndex` stays private when
no `indexSignal` is passed.

**`Carousel`'s argument does not carry over, and it is worth being exact about why, since the two now sit on
opposite sides.** There the library owns every button because the rotation is automatic and WCAG 2.2.2 requires
a stop mechanism that is not the author's to omit — a carousel with no controls is one nobody can stop. A wheel
has nothing to stop: the idle turn is ended by the spin and by the consumer's own switch, both recorded above,
and the spin itself only ever happens because someone asked for it. So the button the wheel rendered was
carrying no conformance load, and what is left is `Scroller`'s trade — the consumer renders the button, inherits
naming and the focus ring and the disabled treatment from `Button`, and the library keeps only what nobody else
can know.

**The cost is stated rather than mitigated: a library that renders no button cannot promise one is reachable or
named.** A consumer who wires up no control has a wheel that can only be driven from elsewhere through
`indexSignal`, exactly as `Carousel` with no `renderControls` has no keyboard route. That is the same exposure
item 18 records for `Scroller` and it is now the wheel's too.

**No slot survives either, and the one that briefly did was kept for a bad reason.** A `renderHub` was left on
the overhead wheel out of deference to an earlier choice — that an overhead wheel has one control slot and it is the
hub. The user axed it. That choice was about where a **button** goes and there is no button
now; intrinsically the slot contributed one number, `inset: 35%`, which is paint, and a consumer who wraps the
wheel in a positioned box writes it themselves. The Playground does exactly that. `OverheadWheel` renders wedges
and nothing else, `DrumWheel` renders a barrel and nothing else.

**The handle arrives after the first render, which is a real consequence rather than a wrinkle.** A control
reading `getController()?.getIsSpinnable()` sees `undefined` for the first tick and paints as disabled, because
`onMount` fires after the tree is built. `Typewriter`'s `getController()?.update(…)` has the same shape and the
same tick. Nothing on screen has moved by then, so no consumer has yet been able to press anything.

**The overhead wheel exposes every wedge; the drum hides the ones that have turned away.** All of an overhead wheel's
wedges are painted at once, so all of them are real content. A drum's are not — `backface-visibility` removes
them from the picture — and `Carousel`'s rule applies: a control nobody can see is still in the tab order, so
the faces that are not at the marker are `aria-hidden` and `inert`, and the back faces always are.

**A drum of two wedges renders no backs, because it has no barrel to have an inside.** At three faces and up
the apothem is positive, the faces stand off the axis, and a face that has turned away shows the reverse
printed on its own card — which is what `renderWedgeBack` is for. At two the apothem is zero: the faces are
flat against one another with nothing between them, and the reverse of one _is_ the other. Rendering backs as
well puts a blank card in exactly the same plane as a prize, and since they are coplanar the paint order
decides, so the drum showed a back where a front belonged. `WheelUtils.getHasWedgeBacks` is the guard and it
is a count test rather than an apothem test on purpose — the apothem is also zero while a consumer's wedge
size is still being measured, and backs must not flicker in and out during a measurement.

**A picked wedge and a picked drum face wear the same treatment, and the colour is decided by contrast
rather than by taste.** Asked for by the user, who found the drums had no visible highlight at all: the card
changed its border from `primary.main` to `primary.light` and nothing else, which is not something anyone
notices on a barrel that is turning. Both now take a `secondary.dark` to `secondary.light` gradient behind `secondary.contrast` text — the
flat wedge as a `fill` on its shape, the drum face as a `backgroundImage` on its card, because one is SVG and
the other is a div, and that is the whole of the difference.

**The purple failed WCAG 1.4.3 and the theme was moved rather than the component.** The wheel's picked
wedge was reported as a warning, not patched — see _"A contrast finding in the Playground's own look is a
warning"_ in `CLAUDE.md` — and the user answered by editing the palette itself, which is the right layer:
every consumer of `secondary` gets the correction rather than the one component that happened to be measured.
What moved was `secondary.light` from 60% to 50% lightness and the family's `contrast` token from a pale
lavender to plain white.

Measured on the built page afterwards, so nobody has to take them again:

- **The overhead wheel's label**, 17.35px regular on a 340px wheel, so normal text needing 4.5:1: **7.04:1**, up
  from 3.41:1.
- **The drum card's text**, 14px regular, the same pairing: **7.04:1**, up from 3.41:1.
- **The drum card's rank badge**, `primary.main` at 24px, which is large text needing 3:1: **4.10:1**, up from
  2.61:1 — clearing the normal-text bar too, so it is safe if the badge ever shrinks.

**A palette pairing that nothing renders is not a finding.** `info.contrast` on `info.main` is 4.03:1 and on
`info.light` 4.15:1, both short of 4.5:1 — and neither is reached, because `info.contrast` has no consumer
anywhere in the Playground. `info.light` is used, but as a foreground on `surface`, which is a different sum.
Worth knowing before that token is first used for text, and not worth changing on its own.

**Only the front faces can be picked, and the back's stripes are left alone.** A back face carries the same
index as its front, so it is flagged as picked at the same moment — but `backface-visibility` means a back is
visible exactly when its front has turned away, and a face that has turned away is not at the marker. The two
conditions cannot both hold, so nothing was needed to keep the highlight off the striped side.

**The marker is drawn by the Playground, not by the wheel, and it needs no arithmetic at all.** All three
demos put a `PageWheelPip` — a filled triangle — against the edge of the box that the wedge at rest fills, so
whatever the wheel has stopped on has the pip touching it. The wheel never has to say where that is, because
the resting position is fixed by the geometry already recorded above: `getIndexAngle` turns the chosen wedge
to zero degrees, and at zero degrees an overhead wheel's wedge is drawn straight up and a drum's face is the one
squarely in front. So the pip is a static piece of paint at a known edge, and nothing about it moves or is
measured.

**Which edge it sits on follows the direction of travel, not the variant.** Faces that travel sideways — a
overhead wheel's rim and a drum on the upright axis — take the pip above, pointing down; the reel's faces travel
up and over, so it takes the pip at the left, pointing in. `PageWheelPip` accepts that as `getSide`, one of
`"top"` or `"left"`, and the same class both places the box and turns the glyph. It hangs 70% of its own size
outside the edge, so the tip crosses onto the wedge and the body reads as sitting outside it.

**The drums needed a box of their own to be measured against, and `PageWheelStack` could not be it.** The flat
demo's stack is a full-width block because `OverheadWheel` is `width: 100%` inside it, and a box that shrinks to
its content cannot give a percentage width anything to resolve against. A drum's own girth box is definite
pixels, so `PageWheelMount` is `width: fit-content` with automatic side margins: it ends up exactly the girth
box, whose top edge is the front face's top edge and whose left edge is the front face's left edge. That is
the whole difference between the two wrappers, and it is why there are two.

**The pip is outside the wheel's element, which is what keeps the drum's geometry assertion honest.** The
Playwright check compares the box a drum reserves against the boxes its faces occupy, reading both from inside
`[aria-roledescription="wheel"]`. The pip is a sibling of that element rather than a child, so it can hang over
the edge without the check reading the overhang as a drum painting outside its room.

### `Barrel`: the drum, lifted out of the wheel so a second component can turn one

A drum and a carousel are the same picture driven by different arithmetic — a barrel of faces seen through a
perspective, turned to bring one of them to the front. What differs is where the angle comes from: `Rotator`'s
spin, overshoot and settle for a wheel, an index and a step for a carousel. So the barrel is now an abstract
and the angle is its caller's.

**The abstract renders, which most of `Abstracts` does not.** `Rotator`, `Anchor` and `Virtualizer` are state
with no DOM at all. `Barrel` is four nested elements — a girth box, a perspective box, the barrel itself, and
one absolutely positioned element per face — and lifting only the arithmetic would have left both consumers
holding the same markup and the same four class names. The split is drawn where it costs nothing: the abstract
owns the box, the depth and every face's `transform`; the consumer owns the element around it, what goes inside
each face, and every word said about them.

**Each face's name and hidden-ness come back through `computeFaceDefs`, because the vocabulary is the
consumer's.** A wheel's faces are wedges and a carousel's are slides, and the two disagree about what is
hidden — a wheel hides everything but the wedge at the front, and only its own rules say so. `Barrel` takes
`faceRoleDescription` and asks per face for a label and whether it is away, then writes `aria-hidden` and
`inert` from the answer. It never decides either.

**The geometry moved and the names stayed, which is what proves the move changed nothing.** `WheelUtils.getApothem`,
`getCircumdiameter`, `getGirth`, `getWedgeExtent` and `getHasWedgeBacks` are now aliases of `BarrelUtils`, so
`Wheel.utils.test.ts` still exercises the same functions through the same published names, and the wheel's own
Playwright suite — including the drum's "paints inside the room it reserves" checks — is unchanged and passes.
That is the same standard the `RotationUtils` conversion was held to.

**The face transform is a function now, rather than a template literal inside the markup.** It was the one
piece of the drum with no test around it: an axis, a face, an angle, an index, a count and an apothem in;
`rotateY(-120deg) translateZ(50px)` out, with a half-turn appended for a back. `BarrelUtils.getFaceTransform`
is unit-tested against those strings, which is cheaper than reading them off a rendered page.

**A barrel carries a transition duration it does not use by default.** The wheel animates its angle frame by
frame and wants no transition at all, so the property is declared and the duration left unset, which is a
transition of zero. A carousel steps its angle in one jump and asks for the duration it already publishes.
Both behaviours live side by side rather than one winning.

### `ElementObserver` reports a size, and the height observer is a view of it

`createBorderBoxSizeObserver` was added for `Satellite`, which needs both axes of both of its elements.
`createBorderBoxHeightObserver` stays exported — it is published API and `Collapsible` uses it — and is now
two lines over the new one, with a `createMemo` so a width-only change does not wake a height consumer. Border
box rather than a client rect, deliberately: a rect measured inside a `Viewport` is the layout value times the
scale factor, and layout numbers are what a positioner has to write back out.

### The hold is one function, and all three consumers call it

**Three components pause while somebody is looking at them, and each had written the test out.** `Toasts`
stops its countdowns, `Carousel` stops advancing, and a wheel stops turning by itself; all three meant
`hovered || focus within || page hidden`, and all three carried their own four handlers, their own
`visibilitychange` effect and their own copy of a `getHasLeft` guard. `InteractionTracker.trackHold(ref)` is now
the only copy, and the user's call was to convert the two existing components rather than leave them pointing
at it.

**It sits in `InteractionTracker` rather than in a folder of its own.** `InteractionTracker.wrapElement` already turns an
element's pointer and keyboard events into state; this is the same job one level out — the region rather than
the control — and `trackDrag` had already established the `track*` verb for "attach listeners, hand back a
signal". A folder for one function would have been discoverable only by someone who already knew it existed.

**Why it carries a Level A requirement rather than being a nicety**: see 2.2.2 under `Rotator`. That is the
argument for one copy. Three copies of a conformance behaviour can drift apart silently, and the fourth
component to want it copies whichever it finds first.

**`mouseenter` / `mouseleave` replaced `mouseover` / `mouseout` plus a containment check.** The pair that does
not bubble already ignores movement between descendants, which is exactly what the guard was reconstructing by
hand. Focus still needs the guard: `focusout` fires on the region when focus moves from one child to another,
and `relatedTarget` is the only way to tell that from focus actually leaving. So the guard survives, used once,
for one of the two axes.

**What proves the conversion changed nothing is the existing specs, not new ones.** `carousel.spec.ts` covers
the hold under the pointer and the hold while a child has focus; `toasts.spec.ts` covers hovering, a hidden tab
and the arithmetic of a countdown resumed half way through. Those were written against the hand-rolled
version and pass unchanged against the shared one.

### One index wrapper, under the name that was already published

**`CarouselUtils.wrapIndex` and `RotationUtils` had the same function**, character for character: bring an
index into range, wrapping at both ends, and answer `0` when there is nothing to index. `CarouselUtils.wrapIndex`
is now that function rather than a second copy of it, which is legal in that direction — a `Fundamental` may
read an `Abstract`. The published name won over the `getWrappedIndex` the wheel work had invented, and the
export stays where consumers already find it.

**Two objections were raised against this and only one of them held.** That `Carousel` would lean on a namespace
named for something it is not: it does not hold, because a carousel's own vocabulary is already rotation —
`getIsRotating`, `renderRotationControl`, `CarouselRotationFlags`. That the old export has to stay: it does not
hold either, since a one-line re-export is a cost every arrangement but "leave both" would pay.

**What held is that the function is not angular arithmetic, so `RotationUtils` was not strictly its home
either.** It is now `MathUtils.wrapIndex` in `ss-utils`, and `RotationUtils` — which lives in that package too
these days — reaches for it like any other caller. See _"What went to `ss-utils`"_. The published
`CarouselUtils.wrapIndex` alias is unchanged and now points there.

### A Playground page returns a fragment, and its demos sit in a `PageMeasureBox`

Both corrected by the user after the four migrated components arrived with neither.

**A page has no root element of its own.** `App.css.ts`'s `tabPanelBody` is a column flex with a gap, and the
things it spaces are the page's own children — the props panel and the variants. A page that wraps them in a
div becomes one child, the gap disappears, and the panel sits flush against the demos. `CarouselPage` is the
shape to copy: `return (<>…</>)`. `ShapePage` gets away with a root because it re-declares the same column and
gap on it, which is the exception rather than the pattern.

**A demo sits in `PageMeasureBox`, not in a box the page invented.** It draws the checkerboard and the dashed
outline that say "this is the space the component asked for", which is exactly what a page hand-rolling a
bordered `host` div is trying to say and says less well. Three of the four pages had their own.

**The outline paints behind the demo, not over it.** It was at `z-index: 1` and drew across whatever it
contained, which stayed invisible for as long as every demo left a margin inside its box — `ElementMosaic`
is the first that fills one edge to edge, and the dashes ran straight over the tiles. A measurement drawn on
top of the thing it measures is the wrong way round. The box now isolates itself and the outline sits at
`z-index: -1`, which puts it above the checkerboard and below everything the page renders into it.

**The box has no padding, and that is the whole point of it.** Stated by the user, twice: the content hugs the
box, so the outline is a measurement rather than a frame. It was defaulting to 20px, which quietly made every
demo on every page smaller than the thing being measured, and three pages had grown a
`size + MEASURE_BOX_PADDING * 2` expression to cancel it back out. The default is now zero and those
expressions are gone. **`TypewriterPage` is the one exception and opts in**, because unpadded text is hard to
read; `MEASURE_BOX_PADDING` stays exported for it.

**The box hugs its content, and that is the same point from the other end.** It reports what the component asked for and
nothing else, so the outline around a demo is a measurement rather than a frame. That was intent and not yet
code: `measureBoxRoot` was a plain block, so a box given no `getWidth` stretched to its card and the outline
was drawn wider than the thing it measured. `width: fit-content` on the class makes it true, and it reaches
only the boxes that pass no width, since an inline `getWidth` overrides it. The consequence, stated by the
user when this was written up the other way round: a component that asks for a share of its parent —
`Formation` and `Staircase` both size themselves as a fraction of their container — has no appetite of its own,
and collapses to nothing inside a box that only grants appetite. That is the box being truthful, not being in
the way. What it forces is that **the page has to state the width it is demonstrating at**, which is what
`getWidth` is for and what `CellAnimationPage` already used it for. Worth naming because the symptom is a demo
that renders and measures as zero rather than one that errors.

### `Mosaic`: one side comes from the parent, the other is what the arrangement costs

Settled with the user across one conversation, from "a grid of sorts that occupies the minimum possible
size". The name is theirs, chosen from three sets — a mosaic is unequal pieces set into a rectangle with
grout between them, and the gap prop is the grout.

**"Minimum possible size" does not define itself, and the size anchor is what fixed that.** Minimum by area,
minimum against a target shape and minimum height for a given width are three different arrangements, and
the first two can come out wider than the parent and spill. `sizeAnchor: "width" | "height"` is
`CellAnimation`'s prop and its vocabulary: one side is taken from the parent, the other is whatever the
arrangement costs, and the objective is to make that second side as small as it goes. Nothing can overflow
the side that was given, and there is no number to tune.

**The two anchors are one algorithm and a transpose, not two.** Sizes go in swapped, placements come back
swapped, and everything between works in one space where the anchored axis is `x` and the free axis is `y`.
`MosaicUtils.transposeSize` and `transposePlacement` are the whole of it.

**The presets differ on exactly one thing: whether an item keeps its size or only its shape.** That is what
made two presets over an unexported base the right shape rather than one component with a mode — a mosaic of
fixed-size elements can never become a mosaic of rescaled images while it is mounted, so the choice is not a
runtime value. Same reasoning as `SpotlightHint` / `SpotlightPrompt` / `SpotlightGuide`, and as `Checkbox` /
`Toggle` / `Radio` over `BinarySwitch`. The base takes the packing function from the preset, which is why
`computePlacements` exists at all; `getIsItemSized` says whether the placement's width and height are written
to the DOM or only its position.

**The packer is a skyline, and the gap is baked into the cell rather than added afterwards.** Every item is
inflated by the gap on its right and bottom edges and packed into a container one gap wider than the real
one. Two neighbours then have exactly one gap between them and the outermost items sit flush against the
edges, with no special case for the first column or the last row. The placement written out is the inflated
cell minus the gap again.

**Items are packed tallest first, and that is what fills the holes.** A short item leaves room under it that
a plain row layout can never reclaim; the skyline records the free space and the next item that fits drops
into it. `elementMosaic.spec.ts` pins the invariant that says so — a tile's top edge is either the top of
the mosaic or exactly one gap below some other tile's bottom edge — because a packer that quietly fell back
to rows would still pass a no-overlap check.

**An item wider than the container overhangs rather than being shrunk.** Shrinking it is the other preset's
job, and silently distorting something the consumer gave a fixed size to is worse than showing that it does
not fit. It reserves the full container width, so nothing is placed beside it.

**The reading order is derived from the finished geometry, and the DOM is rendered in it.** The user's call,
over the safer option of forbidding hole-filling so that placement order and reading order agree by
construction — their reasoning was that a mosaic which leaves its holes open is not a mosaic. So the
arrangement is cut recursively: find a horizontal line no item straddles and the mosaic splits into bands;
within a band find a vertical line and it splits into columns; recurse, alternating. This is how reading
order is recovered from a scanned page. An arrangement that decomposes on neither axis falls back to sorting
by top edge then left edge.

**Which makes the accessibility answer the DOM itself, with no `tabindex` and no ARIA.** WCAG 1.3.2
Meaningful Sequence and 2.4.3 Focus Order are both Level A, and both are satisfied by putting the elements
in the order they read: Tab and a screen reader then follow the eye by construction. The property that
survives every arrangement, and the one the spec asserts, is that an item announced later never sits above
**and** to the left of one announced earlier — announcement may move right and it may move down, and it
never goes back.

**`<For>` runs over the item indices, not over the placements.** A placement is a fresh object on every
pass, so `<For>` would key on nothing stable and rebuild every tile whenever the container resized. Indices
are primitives, `<For>` compares them by value, and reordering therefore moves the existing nodes — which is
what keeps focus on whatever the user was on while the mosaic reflows underneath them. The order memo
compares element by element so an unchanged order does not re-diff at all.

**`readingIndex` is on the item state because nothing else can work it out.** The consumer knows its own
array order and the component decides the announcement order, so a consumer staggering an animation along
the reading order has no other way to ask. Everything else on `MosaicItemState` mirrors `Formation`'s.

**An unplaced item is rendered and hidden, never left out.** Where the sizes come from mounted elements —
which is `ElementMosaic` — an item that is not in the DOM can never be measured and would never earn a
placement, so leaving it out is a deadlock rather than an optimisation. It renders at the origin with `visibility: hidden`, which still measures,
and takes its place on the next pass. That is also what covers the first frame, where nothing has been
measured yet.

**The measuring wrapper is `width: max-content`, and that is what stops the height anchor eating itself.**
An ordinary block inside the positioned wrapper would shrink to fit the container, so its measured width
would depend on the container's width — which, when the height is the anchored side, is itself computed
from the measurements. `max-content` breaks the circle by making an item's width its own business, and it
is the same rule that lets an oversized item overhang.

**Sizes are read with `ElementObserver.createBorderBoxSizeObserver` rather than from a client rect.** A
bounding client rect is the transformed size, so inside a `Viewport` it is the layout value times the scale
factor and the whole mosaic packs against numbers that are wrong by a constant. `ResizeObserver`'s
`borderBoxSize` is the layout box and no transform touches it.

### `ImageMosaic`: no smallest to aim at, so it is given a shape to aim at instead

**"Make the free side as small as possible" is degenerate once the component picks the sizes.** With fixed
elements the objective has an answer; with images it does not, because the smallest arrangement is always one
row with everything scaled down — sixty images across a 380px column is sixty slivers, technically minimal
and useless. So the preset needs a second thing to aim at, and three were weighed: a target thickness for a
row in pixels, a floor under how small an image may get, and a target shape for the finished mosaic. The
user took the shape.

**The target is a width and a height, not one number, and that is theirs.** `{ width: 16, height: 9 }` says
which way round it goes at the call site; a bare `1.78` does not, and the reader has to know whether the
library divides width by height or the other way. It defaults to `{ width: 1, height: 1 }`, so a consumer
who has no opinion gets something close to a square.

**The row count is not asked for and not guessed: it is scanned for.** Splitting the images into more rows
makes each row shorter and the mosaic taller, so the finished height rises with the row count. The scan runs
the count upward from one, stops at the first count whose mosaic overshoots the target height, and keeps
whichever of that count and the one before it lands nearer. Nothing is tuned and there is no window
constant to defend.

**Within a row count, the split is a dynamic program rather than a greedy fill.** For a candidate count the
target height divides into an ideal thickness per row, and the program picks the split minimising the summed
squared deviation from it — the standard way a justified image wall is laid out. A greedy pass closing each
row as soon as it is full is cheaper and visibly worse: it pushes all the slack into the last row. The cost
is the honest one for a dynamic program, quadratic in the images per row count tried, so a mosaic of several
hundred images is doing real work on every resize.

**Rows run over the order given, and nothing is reordered.** The element preset reorders because reordering
is how a hole gets filled; here every row fills its side exactly by construction, so there is no waste to
reclaim and reordering would only shuffle the images for nothing. The reading order derived from the
geometry therefore comes back equal to the order passed in, which costs nothing and keeps the two presets on
one mechanism.

**The preset transposes the target shape, not the base.** The base swaps the axes so that one packer serves
both anchors, and a target shape stated by the consumer is in the consumer's axes — so with the height
anchored, a 16:9 target has to reach the packer as 9:16. `ImageMosaic` does that swap itself because it is
the only thing that knows the target exists; `computePlacements` stays "whatever the preset wants" and the
base stays a mechanism with no opinion about what is being packed.

**Every source carries a text alternative, because WCAG 1.1.1 Non-text Content is Level A.** A wall of
images with no alternatives fails outright, so the array is `{ src, alt }` rather than bare strings and a
deliberately decorative wall says so by passing an empty string. Not a house preference — the criterion
leaves no room, and it outranks any argument about how tidy `string[]` would have been.

**The measuring copy of an image is never mounted.** `new Image()` with a `src` fires `load` and reports
`naturalWidth` without ever being in the document, so the component learns every shape without owning
anything the consumer can see. The first build mounted a hidden `<img>` per source instead and concluded
from that that the consumer could never be given the element to render — a wrong conclusion, corrected by
the user, and the reason the render slot below exists at all.

**Which also means every source is fetched up front, and there is no lazy path.** The layout cannot start
until every shape is known, so deferring a file defers the whole arrangement rather than one tile. The
visible image and the measuring copy share a URL, so the browser serves the second from cache and only one
request leaves the machine. Attributes that split the cache — a `crossorigin` or a `referrerpolicy` a
consumer sets on their own markup — would cost a second fetch, which is the one case where the two copies
stop being free.

**An image that fails to load keeps a square box.** Dropping it would take its alternative text out of the
document along with it, so a reader who cannot see the wall would not be told the picture was ever there.
A square is the honest guess when the shape is unknowable.

**`renderItem` hands over the image, and the cell keeps the size.** Without it the component renders its own
`<img>` and the preset behaves as before. With it the consumer receives `renderImage` — the library's
element, built and ready to place — plus the item state, and returns whatever they want around it: an
anchor, a `<figure>` with a caption, a `<picture>` with a srcset. Same shape as `DatePicker`'s
`renderCalendar`, `TimePicker`'s `renderClock` and `Select`'s `renderOptions`: the library builds, the
consumer places.

**The size is forced by the cell being a one-cell grid, not by asking the consumer to honour a number.**
Publishing the computed size as a prop was weighed and dropped: it hands over a decision the component has
already taken, cannot revise and cannot verify, so a consumer who quietly ignores it gets overlapping tiles
that nothing detects. The cell carries the pixel width and height, `display: grid` puts every direct child
into the single cell, and a grid item is blockified — so a bare inline `<a>` becomes a full-size click
target with no CSS from the consumer at all, and several returned elements each fill the cell instead of
splitting it into rows. An explicit width or height on their element still beats the stretch, which is
deliberate: it is what lets `ElementMosaic`'s `max-content` measuring box keep its own size inside the same
wrapper, so one mechanism serves both presets.

**The cell does not clip, and that is the user's call.** `overflow: hidden` was proposed to stop a long
caption spilling across the gap and rejected on the case it forecloses — an image that grows on hover. What
happens to paint inside or outside the box is the consumer's half, the same line the library draws around
`Shape` and around the `Toasts` painter; the box's job is only to be the right size. The consequence worth
knowing is that a grown tile paints **under** the tiles after it, since later siblings win ties, and the
cell wrapper is deliberately not a stacking context — so `position: relative` plus a `z-index` on the
consumer's own element reaches past its neighbours and lifts it clear.

### `RichText`: a tag name is what you could write after a dot in JavaScript

The parser used to accept letters and nothing else, so `[tag1]` and `[h1]` were not tags — they came out as
the characters they were typed as. The user asked for digits, and for the widest set that still makes sense,
which raised the question the answer is easy to get wrong: **an object key is not a limit.** Every property
key in JavaScript is a string, so `""`, `"hello world"` and `"[b]"` are all valid keys, and the class map
here is a `Record<string, string>` that would take any of them. Nothing about the map constrains the syntax.

What does constrain it is that the text around a tag is ordinary prose, and prose contains square brackets.
So the rule chosen is the **identifier** rule — the subset JavaScript itself accepts after a dot: a letter or
an underscore first, then letters, digits and underscores. `[tag1]`, `[h1]` and `[my_tag]` are tags;
`[123]`, `[b-c]`, `[$5]` and `[2024-01]` are not, and pass through as text.

**The hyphen is the interesting exclusion**, because a markup vocabulary would usually take one. It is out
for the same reason it is out of an identifier, and the practical benefit is that a date-shaped or
reference-shaped bracket in someone's text cannot become a tag. `$` is out too, despite being legal in an
identifier, because `[$5]` is a plausible thing to have written on purpose.

**What was already decided and is unchanged:** tags are found case-insensitively and matched
case-sensitively, so `[B]bold[/B]` is recognised as a tag, finds no class under `"B"` and prints its own
brackets. Both halves are pinned by name in `RichText.utils.test.ts`, as is the exclusion of `[123]` and
`[b-c]`.

### `RichText`: the class map is handed over whole, and the diff example is what proves it

`computeClassNames` is given the library's own map and returns the one to paint with, so a consumer choosing
to keep the defaults spreads them and a consumer choosing to replace them simply does not. That is the whole
contract, and the shape it takes was never visible from the page until an example reached the prop: the page
took the defaults, so a map that failed to arrive at all would have looked identical.

**The example that reaches it is an inline diff**, over two tags the library has never heard of — `[add]` and
`[sub]`. A diff is the case that makes the argument on its own: nobody would expect a component to ship an
insertion or a deletion colour, the two tags are obviously the page's rather than the library's, and the
sentence being diffed can carry a `[b]` inside an `[add]` to show that the default map came through the same
call unchanged. The tags are named after what they mark rather than after what they look like, which is why
they are not `green` and `red`.

**How the two runs are drawn is the user's, and the spec does not touch it.** The correction that fixed this
file: the first version struck the deletion through and underlined the insertion, argued it from WCAG 1.4.1
Use of Color, and wrote both into `richText.spec.ts`. The user removed the underline, and the spec went red —
which is the failure mode to learn from, because nothing was broken. A spec that pins the decoration or the
colour of a Playground run has made the user's own styling a thing they cannot change without a red run, and
the paint on that page is theirs. The grounds are `success.dark` and `error.dark` with each family's own
`contrast` for the text, under the rule that a container changing its own background owns the colour of the
text inside it; beyond that, nothing here states what the diff must look like.

**`richText.spec.ts` reads no computed style at all, and that is the general rule rather than a quirk of this
page** — see _"An assertion reads the mapping, not the value"_ below. What `computeClassNames` promises is a
lookup: a tag comes back carrying the class it was mapped to. So the legend's check is that all five default
tags reach a class and that no two reach the same one; the diff's is that `[add]` and `[sub]` reach classes of
their own; and the check that the defaults survived the page's spread is that the `[b]` inside an `[add]` run
carries **the same class** as the `[b]` in the legend. Not one of those says what a class draws, so all of them
survive a restyle on either side.

### `PointerTracker`: one reading of where the pointer is relative to one element

The abstract answers a single question — where is the pointer, relative to this box — and everything a
consumer paints from it is arithmetic on that answer. The brief was a grid of squares that light as the pointer
nears, a card whose cast shadow swings away from the pointer, and a surface under a veil with a hole at the
pointer; the veil became the `Reveal` `Exotic` and left the abstract's page, and the shadow turned out to need
no second element at all — a `box-shadow` whose offset, blur and alpha come from the reading does it, which is
the honest version of the demo and one fewer div in the tree.

**The page's examples are the user's pick, and two were cut after they ran them.** A card that started
fetching when the pointer came within three radii, and the veil the `Exotic` replaced. Recorded so neither is
re-proposed: the fetch-on-approach one was making a point about the reading being data rather than paint, and
that point did not survive contact with a demo where nothing visible happens.

**The magnet's reach is in pixels, not in radii, and that is the example's whole lesson.** It first used the
edge ratio like the lamps, and on a wide, short button that made the vertical reach about twenty pixels — the
element's own radius upwards is half its height. A magnet's field is a distance, so it reads `distance`
against a pixel range, eased so the pull is already visible at the far end of it rather than creeping in over
the last few pixels. The lamps keep the edge ratio because a lamp's glow really is a property of its shape.
Both numbers are in the reading precisely so a consumer can pick the one that matches what it is modelling.

**The magnet tracks the box it sits in, not itself, and this is the feedback trap `trackSwipe` already
documents.** An element that leans towards the pointer moves the very box its reading is measured from, so the
next reading is taken from the displaced position and the direction wanders as the pointer closes in. The fix
here is not a frozen rect but a different subject: the tracker watches the stage, which never moves, and the
transform goes on the button inside it. That is also the truer model — a magnet's pull is a property of where
the thing rests, not of where it has already been dragged to.

**The lean is a fraction of the offset, capped — not a fixed length along the direction.** The first two
versions multiplied a unit direction by a constant scaled by the falloff, which is wrong in the way that is
easiest to miss: the falloff is strongest at the centre, so the button jumped its full travel towards a pointer
sitting almost on top of it and only snapped back to nothing at the exact centre, where the direction
degenerates. Reported by the user as the button not being centred when the pointer is. The reading was not at
fault — the compass on the same page reads `distance: 0px` at its own centre — the arithmetic on top of it was.
Taking `distance × follow ratio × pull` gives the behaviour the name promises: nothing at the centre, and a
reach that grows as the pointer approaches without ever overshooting it.

**What limits the reach is the room the box leaves, not a constant.** A fixed maximum was the first answer and
it was visibly wrong in the way the user reported next: the button stopped short of the edges with no
explanation, because thirty-four pixels is less than the travel a two-hundred-and-eighty-pixel stage allows a
button half its width. The cap is now `(stage − button) ÷ 2` per axis, from two
`ElementObserver.createBorderBoxSizeObserver` calls, and it is clamped per axis rather than along the
direction — so a pointer off one corner slides the button along the edge it has already reached instead of
stopping in mid-air. Measured flush on all four sides.

**The reading carries pixels _and_ a ratio, because the two answer different questions.** A pixel offset from
the element's centre is isotropic, so the angle derived from it is the true direction on any shape; a ratio of
the box says where inside the box the pointer sits, which is what a mask position wants and what
`trackDrag` already reports. Reporting only the ratio would have distorted the angle on a non-square element —
a bar 400 by 40 would call a shallow approach 45° — and reporting only pixels would have left every
mask-positioning consumer dividing by a size it has to measure again. Both fall out of one measurement, so
carrying both costs nothing.

**The user's contribution, and the part that makes the reading shape-aware: `edgeOffset`.** Draw the line from
the element's centre through the pointer and record where it leaves the box. `distance / edgeDistance` is then
one number that means the same thing on any element: below `1` the pointer is inside, `1` is on the edge, `2`
is a further element-radius away. A wide bar reports a short reach sideways and a long one along its length,
so a falloff written against it lights the way a bar-shaped lamp actually would, with no consumer arithmetic
about aspect ratio. It is also scale-free by construction — both lengths are measured in the same space, so an
ancestor scale divides out, the same immunity `trackDrag`'s ratio has.

**The boundary is the element's rectangle, so a rounded element over-reports its corners** — a circle made
with a 50% radius says its diagonal reaches about 1.4 times as far as it is drawn. Left alone: none of the
three consumers is round, and teaching the abstract about shapes means either reading `border-radius` back out
of computed style or taking a shape argument, both of which are a lot to carry for a decoration.

**The arithmetic went to `ss-utils` as `RectUtils.getEdgePointTowards`.** It needs only the language, which is
the line for that package, and the degenerate case follows a rule already recorded there: the centre has no
direction to leave in, so it reports the middle of the right-hand edge, matching `Point2dUtils.getAngle`
reporting `0` for the origin.

**One document listener and one frame, shared by every consumer, because an element cannot hear a pointer that
never touches it.** The listener has to be on the document, and the lamp grid alone calls `create` twelve
times, so a listener per consumer would be twelve listeners and twelve `getBoundingClientRect` calls per
pointer event. Instead the module holds the client point and a subscriber set, `pointermove` marks the frame
dirty, and one `requestAnimationFrame` recomputes every subscriber — the `DismisserStack` shape, which
attaches on the first consumer and detaches on the last. Scroll and resize mark the same frame dirty, since a
page moving under a still pointer changes every reading.

**`getIsPointerPresent` is returned from every `create` call even though it is module state**, so a consumer
reads one thing and never has to know which parts of the reading are shared.

**A resting reading rather than an absent one, and it rests infinitely far away.** The reading is never
`undefined`: before the first pointer event, and on a touch device where the pointer only exists while a
finger is down, it reports `distance` and `edgeRatio` of `Infinity` with a zero offset. That is the honest
statement — infinitely far away, in no particular direction — and it means the arithmetic path never branches:
a falloff clamps to nothing lit, an offset multiplied by a normalised zero direction displaces nothing. Zeros
would have been the wrong resting value, since a zero distance is the pointer at the centre, which is every
effect at full strength. **After a pointer has been seen the last reading is kept**, and
`getIsPointerPresent` goes false, so a consumer can fade out from where it was rather than snapping — which
is what leaving a room looks like. A consumer ignoring the flag gets an effect frozen mid-strength; that was
weighed and accepted as the price of not making the reading optional.

**Reduced motion is the consumer's to answer, and the abstract does not touch it — see
`MediaQueryMonitor` below for where the preference is read.** Considered and rejected: the abstract
suppressing the reading itself. It cannot do the thing the preference actually asks
for. The platform preference is to "remove, **reduce, or replace**" motion, and success criterion 2.3.3
Animation from Interactions (AAA) covers only motion animation triggered by interaction — its own definition
excludes changes of colour and opacity that do not change perceived size, shape or position, with an erratum
amending it to no longer exclude blurring. So the lamp's brightness is outside the criterion entirely, while
the shadow's offset and blur and the reveal's travelling hole are inside it. An abstract that stops reporting
can only delete, and it would delete the brightness along with the movement; only the consumer knows which of
its own responses is motion, and only the consumer can substitute. The three examples each answer differently:
the lamp keeps its brightness and drops its glow, the shadow pins its offset and blur and keeps responding
through opacity alone, and the reveal replaces the travelling hole with the whole veil fading.

**The abstract briefly published the preference alongside the reading, and does not any more.** The user's
question closed it: a consumer can read a media query in CSS with no JavaScript at all, or in about ten lines
of signal and listener, so publishing it bought a saved listener rather than a capability the consumer lacked.
What survived the question is the observation that made it non-trivial — a `PointerTracker` consumer paints
from computed numbers as inline styles, and a CSS media query cannot withdraw an inline style without
`!important` — and that is an argument for the preference being reachable from JavaScript, not for a pointer
abstract being the one to hand it out.

**The Playground gained an `Abstracts` category for it**, ahead of `Exotics`. Nothing that renders no DOM had
a page before; the alternative was filing it under `Exotics`, which is the folder for things that do render.

### `MediaQueryMonitor`: a media query as an accessor, shared per query

Extracted on the user's call, from the flag `PointerTracker` briefly published and the ten lines `WheelPage`
briefly held: the reduced-motion preference should be reachable from plain JavaScript by anything that needs
it, rather than riding on an abstract that measures something else.

**It is a media query rather than a preference, because the mechanism is the general one.**
`MediaQueryMonitor.create(query)` returns an accessor of whether the query matches, and
`createReducedMotion()` is the one named shortcut over it, so the query string is written once in the library
and nowhere else. Naming the general thing was the choice over a `ReducedMotionMonitor`: the next preference
worth reading — forced colours, reduced transparency, a colour scheme — is the same code with a different
string, and a monitor per preference would be a file each.

**One `MediaQueryList` and one listener per distinct query, however many consumers ask.** A module-level map
keyed by the query string holds the signal and a subscriber count; the first consumer opens the listener and
the last closes it, the `DismisserStack` shape again. The lamp grid is the case that makes it matter —
twelve consumers on one page, which as a listener each is what `Rotator` used to do with one wheel and would
have done badly with twelve. The signal stays in the map after the last consumer leaves, so a page mounting
the same query again reuses it rather than flickering from a stale `false`.

**Nothing in the library reads it internally.** `Rotator` stopped consulting the preference when the wheel's
enforcement was removed, and `PointerTracker` never did anything with it. Every consumer is a Playground page
or example, which is the point: the library reports, the consumer decides.

### The Playground's `Abstracts` category, and which four earn a page

The category exists because `PointerTracker` had nowhere honest to go: `Exotics` is things that render DOM, and
it renders none. The user's call was to keep the category rather than file it wrongly or ship no page at all —
the one Abstract with no component consumer would otherwise be the only thing in the library you cannot look
at.

**Four Abstracts earn a page, and the test is whether anything already shows them.** `PointerTracker` has no
component consumer at all. `InteractionTracker` is seen today only through a colour surface, a drawer and a
carousel, which show what it is used for rather than what it reports. `Virtualizer` was visible only inside a
stress-test modal buried in the Select page. Everything else is either already on screen through the component
that consumes it — `Rotator` through the wheels, `ElementFader` through every overlay, `Dismisser` and
`FocusManager` through the modal, `Typeahead` through select, `MaskedField` through the inputs, `ColorExtractor`
through the colour input — or would be a page of numbers changing, which is `ElementObserver`, `SignalMirror`,
`TextSync`, `MediaQueryMonitor`, `LiveAnnouncer` and `FrameRateMonitor`.

**`Anchor` was argued for and rejected by the user: it is already everywhere.** Tooltips, menus, selects and
the spotlight all position through it, so a page would be a fourth showing of a thing three pages already show.

**This is a Playground answer, not a documentation answer.** The user's note, recorded because it changes the
shape of the question later: the site is a showcase today and will likely become documentation, and at that
point every Abstract needs a page whether or not it has anything to demonstrate. The four-page rule is about
what is worth demonstrating, not about what is worth documenting.

**Also raised by the user and not built: listing, in each component page's description, which Abstracts it
uses.** The objection they raised themselves is maintenance — a hand-written list rots the moment a component
gains an import. Worth knowing before anyone attempts it: the dependency is already in the import graph, and
the Playground already runs a build-time plugin over its own source for the source viewer, so the list is
derivable rather than curated. Nothing has been decided.

### `Reveal`: a cover with a hole where the pointer is

The user's suggestion, made while looking at the `PointerTracker` example that does the same thing by hand.
Both now exist and that is deliberate: the example on the abstract's page shows the reading is enough to build
this yourself, and the `Exotic` is the packaged one.

**The cover is the consumer's and the hole is the component's.** `renderContent` is what is hidden,
`renderCover` is what hides it, and the component contributes only the mask that cuts the hole and the
positioning that lays one over the other. The mask is computed here and applied there — see _"The mask is
handed to `renderCover`"_ below. This follows `Spotlight`'s split — that component owns the hole in an
overlay and hands the overlay's paint to `renderOverlay` — and it is why the frosted, opaque and text-carrying
covers on the Playground page are all the same component with nothing switched. The two now share the mask
builder as well as the shape of the handout: see _"`Spotlight`'s overlay is one masked layer and one clipped
layer"_ for `Abstracts/Cutout` and for what a mask cannot do about the pointer.

**`renderCover` is handed whether a reveal is happening.** A cover that says "nothing to see here" until the
pointer arrives needs to know, and the alternative — the consumer tracking the pointer a second time to find
out — would make the component the harder way to do it. The flag is true only while the pointer is inside the
element, which is also what the reduced-motion path keys off.

**The cover takes no pointer events.** Its text was selectable, which is wrong twice over: a cover is paint
rather than content, and a caret dragged across it is a pointer interaction the thing has no business
answering. `pointer-events: none` on the cover layer settles it. The consequence, stated rather than fixed:
the content underneath then takes those events instead, so a determined visitor can select the hidden text
through the cover. Hiding it from selection as well is the consumer's to decide, and it is not something a
mask could ever have promised — the content is in the document either way.

**The hole is a small SVG image, not a gradient.** A `radial-gradient` can only be a circle or an ellipse,
which is what shut the door on every other shape, so the hole is drawn as an SVG blurred by `softness` and
composited against a full-coverage layer with `mask-composite: exclude`, which is Baseline widely available
since December 2023. **The image depends only on the three shape props, never on the position**, so it is
built once per shape change and moved with `mask-position`; regenerating a data URI every frame would have
been an image decode per pointer move. Following the pointer in pixels needs the element's own size, which the
reading deliberately does not carry, so the component observes it with `ElementObserver` — visible now in the
page's derived dependency row, which is the mechanism working as intended.

**`radius` and `softness` rather than a gradient string.** Softness is the fraction of the radius that is fully
clear before the mask starts fading back to opaque, so `1` is a hard-edged hole at the full radius and `0` is
all fade — the drawn shape shrinks as the blur grows, until only the very centre comes close to fully clear.
The Playground labels the field _Clear fraction_ for that reason.
Handing the consumer the gradient instead would have made the hole's geometry their arithmetic rather
than the component's, and `radius` and `softness` name the effect where a gradient string names the mechanism.
That the hole is a mask is no longer hidden — the paragraph below says why — but building it is still the
component's job and only the finished style crosses the boundary.

**An arbitrary hole is `computePoints`, the same callback `Shape` takes**, and `joinRadii` and
`lameExponents` come with it. The component passes the points to `ShapeUtils.getPaths` — which lives in
`@thewaver/ss-utils` rather than inside `Shape`, so nothing had to be extracted to reach it — and drops the
resulting outline into the mask image in place of the built-in shape. A consumer who wants a hexagon writes
the callback every `Shape` consumer already writes, and rounded or bevelled or scooped corners are the same
two props they would use there.

**`roundness` was deleted rather than kept beside it.** It ran the hole from a square to a circle, which is
a four-point outline with a join radius said a second way — and the second way only worked while no points
were given, so a page carrying both would have shown a control that silently stopped mattering. A rounded
square now comes from four points and a `joinRadii`, and the Playground's _Corner radius_ and _Corner style_
fields are disabled while the shape is the default circle, which is the honest form of the same fact.

**With no `computePoints`, the hole is a circle drawn as a `<circle>`**, decided by the user. The alternative
was a polygon standing in for one, which is worse at every count the component cares about: more points to
blur, a visible facet count at large radii, and arithmetic in the common case that the SVG element does
exactly. The points are computed in the image's inner box rather than its full square — the blur needs room
inside the image or it clips at the edges — and the outline is then translated by that same inset.

**The mask is handed to `renderCover`, not applied by the component.** The signature is
`renderCover(getIsRevealing, getMaskStyle)` and the consumer spreads that style onto its own cover element;
the component's cover layer keeps only its positioning and `pointer-events: none`. The idiom already existed
one component over — `Shape` hands `renderChildren` a `getClipPath` for the consumer to put on its own
element, and `Surface` is the in-library consumer that does exactly that.

**What forced the change is a browser rule about filters.** An element carrying a mask becomes a _backdrop
root_: it seals whatever is painted behind it off from `backdrop-filter` on anything inside it. While the
component owned the mask, a frosted cover — the consumer's element, sitting inside the component's masked
layer — had nothing left to blur the moment the pointer arrived and the mask appeared. So the blur existed
only at rest and vanished on the first pointer move, which is the opposite of the effect the example claimed.
Mask and filter on the same element and both hold together. This is what makes the whole family reachable:
content greyed or blurred everywhere with colour and detail restored inside the hole is a `backdrop-filter`
on the cover and nothing else.

**The cost, accepted rather than mitigated.** `Shape`'s handout is optional — ignore `getClipPath` and the
shape still draws correctly, since the clip only matters to children that must sit inside the outline.
`Reveal`'s is the entire product: a cover that never applies the style shows no hole at all, and nothing can
detect the omission to warn about it. The alternative weighed against it was keeping the mask on the
component's layer _and_ handing it out, which masks a filtering cover twice and makes one `softness` value
produce two different edges depending on which path the consumer took. A silent divergence in what a prop
means was judged worse than a silent omission, and the user took the call on the grounds that nothing here is
irreversible yet.

**It reads no preference of any kind, and reduced motion is the consumer's to answer.** The first build had
the component substituting for itself — under reduce, no travelling hole and the whole cover fading instead —
on the argument that the motion is not incidental here but is the entire component. The user rejected it: the
rule set with the wheel holds for a component too, so the library reports and the consumer decides.

**What made that answerable rather than a refusal is `radius`.** A radius of zero cuts no hole while the
tracking carries on, so `getIsRevealing` still reports whether the pointer is inside. A consumer answering the
preference therefore writes one expression — zero radius under reduce — and fades its own cover on the flag it
is already handed, which is the substitution the preference actually asks for rather than the deletion
`isDisabled` would give. **The general rule this settled: a component or abstract that reports rather than
enforces has to leave the consumer a way to express the answer, or "the consumer decides" is a refusal wearing
a rule's clothes.** A Playground example demonstrating exactly that was built and then cut on the user's call,
so the door is recorded here rather than shown there.

**`transitionDurationMs` went with the substitution.** It existed to time the cover's fade; with the fade now
the consumer's, the transition belongs in the consumer's own stylesheet, and a prop timing a transition the
component no longer performs is dead API.

### Which Abstracts a page's component uses, derived rather than curated

Asked for by the user, and built only because the maintenance objection they raised themselves turned out to
be answerable: a hand-written list of each component's Abstracts rots the moment a component gains an import,
and nobody will re-check fifty pages after every commit.

**The dependency is already in the import graph, so nothing is typed twice.** A Vite plugin walks
`components/src` at build time, follows relative imports transitively from each component's entry file, and
classifies every file it reaches by the folder that owns it — `Abstracts/<Name>` is an abstract, anything under
`Fundamentals`, `Composites` or `Exotics` is a component. The result reaches the Playground as a virtual module
and renders under each page's description. In the dev server the plugin watches `components/src` and reloads
the module, so the list is right without a restart.

**Transitive rather than direct, deliberately.** `Wheel` lists `Barrel`, `InteractionTracker`, `LiveAnnouncer`,
`Rotator` and `SignalMirror` — `Rotator` is imported by the wheel itself, `LiveAnnouncer` through the shell it
wraps. Direct imports would have answered "which files does this one file name", which is a fact about the code
layout; the reader's question is which abstracts are running when this component runs, and that is the
transitive set.

**Type-only imports do not count.** `import type` names a type and runs nothing, so counting it would list an
abstract a component merely borrows a shape from.

**Internal components are listed alongside exported ones.** `Select` names `InteractionWrapper` and `FormField`,
neither of which a consumer can import. The alternative — filtering to what `index.ts` exports — would have
made the list a partial truth for the sake of tidiness, and the list is describing what runs, not what can be
bought.

**A name links to its page when one exists.** The matching is case-insensitive, because the Playground's
display names and the folder names disagree in a couple of places (`TypeWriter` against `Typewriter`), and a
name with no page renders as plain text rather than a dead link.

### Colour in the Playground: two rules, both the user's

Stated after a review of the pages built for the `Abstracts`. They are house rules for the Playground's own
paint, not library behaviour, and they are recorded because every new page will otherwise re-invent an answer.

**A background always runs from a family's `dark` to its `light`.** `linear-gradient(135deg, X.dark, X.light)`
with both stops from the same family — not two families mixed, and not a `.main` used as a stop. What went in
before the rule: a card gradient from `primary.dark` to `secondary.main`, and a drag pad from `surface.dark` to
`info.dark`, both of which read as arbitrary because they are.

**`color.background.*` is the page's, and nothing else may use it.** Stated by the user after the first pass
painted every example's stage with a `background.dark` to `background.light` gradient: that family names the
page's own ground, so an example borrowing it is claiming to be the page. The cast-shadow demo is the one
exception, and only because a black shadow needs a light ground to read against; it carries a `secondary.dark`
to `secondary.light` stage of its own.

**What replaces it depends on what the example is showing, and there are three answers.** The correction came
after a second pass wrapped everything in `PageMeasureBox`, which was as wrong as painting everything.

- **`PageMeasureBox`** — the checkered, dash-bordered wrapper — is for an example whose **outer shell matters**:
  something is measured, something moves inside its bounds, or the point is where the component's box ends.
  The compass, lamps, magnet and tilt qualify, because every one of them is about a reading taken against a
  box; so does the swipe, which travels a fraction of its own width. **The interaction flags do not** — nothing
  moves, nothing is measured, and a box around a hover state is decoration pretending to be information.
- **`color.control.background.main`** is for anything that should read as a control's own surface. The
  virtualizer's lists take it, because a scrolling list of rows is what a select's popup is, and the two
  looking alike is the useful signal.
- **A surface-family card** for everything else.

**Text on a background is that family's `contrast`, and a highlight colour has to be checked against the
background it actually lands on.** A highlight is allowed — `primary.main` on a dark surface is fine — but it
travels with the element, and the failure the user caught is what happens when the background moves out from
under it: the virtualizer's row index is `primary.main`, and a pinned row painted itself `secondary.dark`,
leaving teal on warm brown with almost nothing between them. The fix is that the pinned row's own paint claims
the text inside it — a `globalStyle` on the index within a pinned row sets `color: inherit`, so the highlight
gives way to the row's `contrast` rather than surviving into a background it was never checked against.
**The general form: when a container can change its own background, it owns the colour of the text inside
it.**

### Controls: `Sortable`, and why a drag is the least important of its three routes

Asked for by the user as the first piece of game-shaped work. A list whose items can be picked up and put
down, in place or in a sibling list.

**A drag is one route in, and the one that had to be built last.** Success criterion 2.5.7 asks that anything
operated by dragging also be operable by a single pointer **without** dragging, and 2.1.1 asks that it be
operable from the keyboard. So there are three ways in and they are one state machine: a press that moves
beyond the slop starts a drag; a press that does not is a click, and a click picks the item up and the next
click puts it down; `Enter` picks up, arrows choose a place, `Tab` changes list, `Enter` drops and `Escape`
cancels. Building the drag first and bolting the others on afterwards is what produces two state machines that
disagree, which is the shape this avoided rather than discovered.

**Lists find each other through a module-level registry keyed by a group id, not through a wrapper.** Two
lists that exchange items routinely have no useful common ancestor — a hand at the foot of the screen and a
board in the middle, or one of the two inside a `Popover` that is portalled elsewhere — so requiring a shared
parent element would put a layout constraint on the page for a bookkeeping reason. `DismisserStack` is the
precedent and the shape is the same: a module array, `onCleanup` removing the entry. **The registry stays in
the component's own folder rather than under `Abstracts/`**, per the standing rule that a thing is private
until a second consumer asks for it.

**The carried item stays where it is until the drop commits.** The alternative — moving it live, so it is
already in the target while the pointer is still down — reads better and costs two arrays churning against
each other on every pointer move, with the index bookkeeping having to be exactly right at every intermediate
step or an item is lost. Instead the item does not move; the flags say which item is being carried and where
it would land, and the consumer paints a marker at the landing place through `renderMarker`, which the library
positions. Same division as `RadioGroup`'s floater.

**What the library owes the marker is a box, and getting only half of that box right hid the other half.**
The library places the marker and spans it across the axis it is _not_ marking — full width for a column
list, full height for a row — and the consumer paints inside it. The first build made that box a flex row in
both directions, so in a column the consumer's bar had no width to inherit and drew nothing at all: the
landing place existed, was correct, and was invisible, which reads as a control that does not respond. The
wrapper's flex direction now follows the list's, so the child stretches across the right axis.

**The marker sits midway between its two neighbours, and the list is padded by half a gap all round so the
outermost two have a neighbour to be midway from.** The landing place before the first card and after the
last one are the only ones that ever went wrong, and they went wrong twice for the same reason: a list whose
box stops exactly where its cards stop has nowhere to draw a bar. The first build put the end marker a half
gap past the last card, outside the list, over whatever sat beside it; the second clamped it back inside,
which put it _on_ that card. Neither is a position — there was no room, and the fix is to make room. The
padding matches the gap's half, so the space at the ends reads the same as the space between, and the offset
is then the midpoint of the two edges either side of it, with the list's own edges standing in at the
extremes.

**The padding is on all four sides, not only the axis the list runs along, and the marker is inset to match.**
The cross axis needs it for a different reason: a list scrolls, so it clips, and a focus ring is drawn
_outside_ the element it belongs to. Without room on that axis a ring loses its left and right edges. The
marker is inset by the same half gap rather than spanning the padding box, so it is as wide as the list's
content rather than sticking out past it.

**The offset it is placed at is divided by the viewport scale, and this is the fault the whole control took
longest to find.** It is derived from rect differences, which are on-screen, and written as a `top`, which is
layout — see _"A measured rect and a written offset are in different spaces inside a `Viewport`"_ in
`conventions.md`, which this is the entry that produced. Every check passed for as long as it was only ever
driven headless, where the Playground's viewport scale is exactly 1.

**The Playground paints no focus ring of its own, and painting one was a mistake worth recording.** The theme
already carries a global `:focus-visible` outline, so a card was showing three rings at once: the app's, a
solid one the painter drew from the `isFocused` flag, and the dashed border that means _lifted_. The flag one
also fired on plain focus rather than keyboard focus, so it appeared on a click and not on a tab — the
opposite of what a focus ring is for. A painter should reach for `isFocused` only where the app has no ring
of its own.

**How wide a card is stays the consumer's business.** The item element is a flex container, so a painter that
states no width is as wide as its own content and a column of cards comes out ragged. That was briefly
"fixed" by making the element a block so the painter had to fill it — rejected by the user, and rightly: a
list that forces every row to one width is a decision about paint, and the library does not have one. A
consumer who wants even cards writes `width: 100%` in their painter.

**That marker is positioned, never laid out, and the reason is a feedback loop rather than a preference.** The
first build put it in the flex flow between two items, which is the obvious way to draw an insertion point and
is wrong: a marker between two items pushes every item after it along, and the rects it pushed are the ones
the drag measures to decide where the marker belongs. So the answer changed, so the marker moved, so the
answer changed again. A column list spent the whole drag oscillating and read as a control that painted
nothing at all — which is exactly how it was reported. `position: absolute` with the offset computed from the
item rects takes the marker out of the geometry it is describing, and `computeMarkerIndex` converts the
settled index back into the gap it should sit in.

**A drag ends with a click the browser sends unasked, and it has to be swallowed.** Press and release on one
spot is a click; press, move and release is a click as well, on the nearest common ancestor. The first build
let it reach the handler that picks an item up, so releasing a drag immediately picked the same item back up
in tap-to-place mode: it stayed dimmed, the list stayed lit, and every later press was answered by a state
machine the user did not know was running. `trackSwipe` had already met this and its answer is copied — a
capture-phase `click` listener on the list root that swallows exactly one click after a pointer gesture. Worth
holding onto as the general shape: **any gesture built on pointer events owes the click a decision**, because
the browser will send one whether or not the gesture wanted it.

**`renderCarried` is handed the item and nothing else.** The user's call, and the reasoning is theirs: a
consumer may want the card under the cursor, or an outline, or a box, or a count, so what to draw cannot be
the library's decision. It takes no flags — the first build passed some, and having to decide what
`isCarried` should say to a slot that _is_ the carried thing was the sign the argument did not belong there.
Nothing about the copy is interactive: it is not hovered, not focused, not a landing place, and whether it
is disabled is on the item already. A consumer whose painter wants flags supplies a resting set, which is
what the Playground does in one line.

It is portalled into the `Viewport` layer like every other floating element, positioned by transform, sized
from the item it copied, and offset so the card does not jump to its own corner on the first move. Its
pointer position comes from a document-level listener rather than the drag's own moves, so a tap-to-place
carry gets a preview too — the pointer is still there, it is simply not held down.

**That listener also does the aiming, and a tap-carry is what proved it has to.** A carry knows which of
three ways it began — `drag`, `tap` or `key` — because the three differ in what may drive them, not only in
how they read out. A tap-carry has no button held, so its moves never reach the item and the first build
aimed only on the drag's own moves: the copy followed the cursor while the landing place stayed where the
card had been picked up, and the drop then landed somewhere the page had never marked. The document listener
re-aims for `drag` and `tap` and leaves `key` alone, since a stray mouse must not overrule an arrow key.
**With the pointer aiming, the click that drops must not aim again** — it used to re-aim at the centre of
whatever card was clicked, which is a second source of truth and quietly beat the first. **It is `pointer-events:
none`, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy**: the drop target is resolved by asking what sits under
the pointer, and this element sits exactly there, so a hit-testable preview would answer for every drop.

**A row sizes its items to their content and scrolls; a column stretches them and does not.** The first
build passed `sizing="fill"` to every item whatever the direction, copying `Select`'s options — which are
always stacked. In a row that is `width: 100%` on each of several items in one flex line, so they were
squeezed under one another's content and the text spilled out of the list. Sizing is direction-aware now,
list children are `flex: 0 0 auto` so nothing is compressed below what it says, and the list scrolls on its
own main axis when the items do not fit. **The marker offset therefore adds the list's scroll position**,
because it is written as a `left` or `top` against the padding box while the rects it is derived from are
viewport-relative — the two only agree at a scroll of nought, which is the only place it was ever tested
before this.

**A move inside one list is a single write, and a move between two is batched.** The commit used to take the
item out of one array and put it into another as two separate signal writes, which renders once with the item
missing — `<Index>` disposes and rebuilds a slot around that gap for no reason. `moveAt` does a same-list move
in one write and `batch` covers the cross-list pair.

**The index the state machine holds is where the item will end up, not where it would be inserted, and that is
the whole of a bug that shipped once.** The two landing places either side of an item are the same place: an
item put "after itself" has not moved. Counting in landing places therefore spends the first press of an arrow
key going nowhere, which reads as a broken control. So the carry holds a **settled** index — the position in
the list once the item is out of it — and `computeSettledIndex` converts a pointer's landing place into one on
the way in, while `computeMarkerIndex` converts back on the way out so the marker draws between the right two
items. Two presses move two places, which is the only behaviour anybody expects.

**Pointer capture is why the target is found by hit-testing rather than by `pointerenter`.** The drag captures
the pointer on the item so that moves keep arriving after the pointer leaves it — which is also why no other
element ever receives an enter or a leave for the rest of the gesture. The target is therefore resolved by
asking `document.elementsFromPoint` what is under the pointer and matching against the registered lists.
**By containment, not by identity**: the topmost element at a point is whatever the consumer painted, and a
list that only recognised itself when the point landed on its own box recognised itself almost never. That was
the second bug, and it presented as a drag that did nothing at all.

**A list refuses an item before it is offered as a destination, not at the drop.** `computeCanAccept` is
consulted when `Tab` builds the ring of destinations, so a keyboard user is never taken somewhere that will
turn them away and told so only on pressing `Enter`. `isLocked` is the coarse form of the same thing — a list
that can be reordered from inside but takes nothing from outside.

**`InteractionWrapper` owns `tabIndex`, so the roving stop goes through `isTabbable` and nowhere else.** The
first build wrote `tabindex` on the item element in JSX **and** passed `isTabbable={false}` to the wrapper,
copying `Select`'s options — where an option is never a tab stop because the combobox is. Here the roving item
**is** the tab stop, and the wrapper's write landed after the JSX one, so every item ended at `-1` and the
whole list was unreachable by `Tab`. Nothing on screen showed it: every spec that drove the keyboard had
focused an item programmatically first. One writer for a DOM property, the same rule `BinarySwitch` states for
`checked`.

**The list root and the items both set `pointer-events: all`.** `interactionRoot` sets `none` and expects a
control to opt back in, which `Select`'s options already record. Missing it here produced a drag that never
started, with a keyboard route that worked perfectly — the failure mode that rule exists to warn about.

**Every example on the Playground page carries its own group id, which is not a detail.** They shared one at
first, so `Tab` while carrying cycled through the lists of _other examples on the same page_ and a card could
be carried out of the demo it belonged to and dropped somewhere off-screen. A group id is a namespace, and a
page mounting several independent instances has to say so.

**_Elsewhere._** React Aria is the only one of the three with drag and drop, through `useDragAndDrop` shared
with its lists, and its keyboard route is the same pick-move-drop this one implements. Radix and Ark UI ship
nothing in this family, which matches item 15's note that nothing had asked for it. The packages that own the
problem outright — SortableJS, dnd-kit — are pointer-first: dnd-kit ships a keyboard sensor and SortableJS has
no keyboard route at all, which is the same gap `SlideButton`'s entry records for swipe-to-confirm widgets.

### Controls: stateful `Menu` rows, and the run that makes a radio group

The user's call, in their words: extended functionality rather than a `Select` wearing menu paint. `Menu`
had one kind of row — a command you press, which does something and closes the menu. It now has three.

**The kind is a field on the record, not a second component.** `MenuItem<T>` gains `kind?: "command" |
"checkbox" | "radio"`, absent meaning command, so every list written before this is unchanged and a list can
mix all three. A discriminated union in `SelectItem`'s shape was the alternative and buys nothing here: the
three kinds carry the same fields and differ only in what pressing one does, where a `Select` group differs
from an option in having children at all.

**A run of adjacent radio rows is one group, derived rather than declared.** Nothing names a group; the
component walks the list and treats consecutive `radio` rows as a set, boxing them in `role="group"` the way
the published pattern asks. The alternative — a `radioGroup: string` field on each row — is a second thing to
keep in step with the order the rows are written in, and a group whose members are not adjacent is not a
thing a menu can draw anyway. `MenuUtils.getRuns` is the walk; everything that is not a radio is a run of
one, so the render is flat whatever the list holds.

**One signal holds every checked value, radios included.** `checkedSignal: Signal<T[]>` is `MultiSelect`'s
shape, and a radio pick is expressed as set arithmetic over it: drop whatever else in this row's own run is
in the list, then add this one. So a consumer reads one array rather than one array plus a value per group,
and the library needs no notion of a group identity to write it — the run it was handed is enough.

**A tick keeps the menu open and a pick closes it, because that is the split `Select` already made.** A
multi list stays open across a pick and a single one closes; ticking is a thing you do several times and
picking one of a set is a thing you do once. Following the existing decision rather than inventing a third
answer also means the two controls cannot drift apart. Radix arrives at the same behaviour by a different
route — its items close on select unless the consumer prevents it.

**`aria-checked` goes on the two stateful roles and nowhere near a command.** The attribute is what tells a
reader a thing is checkable at all, so a command carrying `aria-checked="false"` would announce one that can
never be checked. `MenuItemFlags` gains `isChecked`; the painter reads the kind off the record it already
has, which is why no `kind` flag was added beside it.

**What the level owes the top and what the top owes back.** A submenu is another `MenuLevel`, so the checked
values are handed down as a read-only accessor and the pick is handed up: `onPick(item, radioGroupValues)`
replaced `onActivate(value)` on the level, because the level is the only place that knows which run a row
belongs to and the top is the only place that owns the signal and can close. The public `onActivate(value)`
is unchanged.
