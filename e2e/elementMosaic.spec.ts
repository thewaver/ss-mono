/**
 * Three properties of the packing can only be confirmed in a browser, because all three depend on sizes the
 * component reads off mounted elements rather than on numbers it was given.
 *
 * The first is that nothing overlaps. The packer places each item on the lowest free spot rather than on a
 * shelf, so an off-by-one in the skyline arithmetic shows up as two tiles sitting on top of each other and
 * as nothing else — the layout still looks broadly plausible.
 *
 * The second is that every item rests on something. A tile's top edge is either the top of the mosaic or
 * exactly one gap below the bottom edge of some other tile, which is what "the next item that fits rises
 * into the hole" means when written down as an invariant. A packer that quietly fell back to rows would
 * still satisfy the no-overlap check and would fail this one.
 *
 * The third is the reading order. Items are rendered in the order they read rather than the order they were
 * passed, so Tab and a screen reader follow the eye — and the property that holds however the arrangement
 * decomposes is that an item announced later never sits above **and** to the left of one announced earlier.
 * Announcement is allowed to move right, and it is allowed to move down; it is never allowed to go back.
 *
 * Items are found by their inline `left`, which only the item wrappers carry. The measure box around the
 * demo and the mosaic root both write inline styles too, but neither writes a position.
 *
 * Both presets share one Playground page, so the demo is addressed by the key of its example rather than by
 * the page: `elements` here, `images` in `imageMosaic.spec.ts`.
