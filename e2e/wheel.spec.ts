/**
 * All three wheels on this page take their rotation from the same abstract, so most of what is checked here is
 * checked once against the overhead one. The drums get the tests about what they alone do differently: hiding the
 * faces that have turned away, and turning about the axis each was given.
 *
 * Everything timed is turned down to the panel's floor first. The spin is a fixed sequence — the page
 * pretends to fetch a prize for 400ms, then the wheel turns for the spin duration, then settles back over
 * the settle duration — so the spec waits on the state the page reports rather than on a frame count.
 *
 * The idle turn has no button of its own — it is part of what the control is — and it no longer stops for
 * anything a visitor does with the pointer. A spin pauses it for the rest duration and then it picks up again,
 * `-1` resting for good. So the only two things that bring the wheel to a standstill are a disabled wheel and a
 * visitor who has asked their system for less motion, and a consumer who wants a pause on hover builds one
 * against `autoSpinSignal` over their own box. The three tests in the middle pin that arrangement: it keeps
 * turning under the pointer, it rests after a spin, and it comes back once the rest has run out.
 *
 * No wheel renders a button any more: the page builds its own and drives it through the handle the wheel hands
 * over at mount. The overhead one is centred over the wheel by a box the page owns, and each drum's
 * sits in a bar the page puts under the barrel — outside the wheel altogether. That is why the spin locator is
 * scoped to the example rather than to the wheel, and why the button's disabled state is checked here at all:
 * it is now the page reading `getIsSpinnable` off the handle rather than the library disabling its own control.
