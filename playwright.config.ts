 * `Viewport` scales its content to the window, and the scale is almost never 1: it is 1 only when the
 * window's **height** equals the Playground's own `SIZE_ANCHOR`, since the derived viewport always
 * matches the window's aspect ratio and `RectUtils.fit` scales up as readily as down. So a client rect
 * measured here — `boundingBox`, `getBoundingClientRect` — is the layout value times that factor, which
 * reads as a component measuring itself wrong. **Assert geometry in layout space** (`offsetWidth`,
 * `offsetHeight`, an inline style the component wrote) and the size of this window stops mattering.
